<BLOCKQUOTE>
MS-DOS does not provide wildcard expansion of command-line arguments to programs. Therefore, some compilers provide for wildcard expansion by linking extra code into the functions that process command line arguments. For example, Microsoft C provides such code in a file named <I>setargv.obj.</I><P>
To provide expansion of wildcards from the command line, you must link <I>setargv.obj</I> with <I>arch.obj. main calls</I> a routine called <I>_setargv</I> to process command line arguments. <I>setargv</I>'s default action is to not expand wildcards. By linking with <I>setargv.obj,</I> you replace the usual <I>_setargv</I> with one that expands wildcards. <I>_setargv. obj</I> is located in the MSC <I>LIB</I> subdirectory. To link in <I>_setargv.obj</I> from the command line use something like<P>
<pre>cl arch.c setargv /link /NOE</pre>
You must use the /NOE link option, otherwise you get a "symbol multiply defined" error. /NOE instructs the linker not to search extended dictionaries, which are lists of symbol locations that speed up searching for references. A makefile for Microsoft's NMAKE.EXE utility is provided in <A href="list4.htm">Listing 4</a>.
<P>
Borland C++ includes a similar file called <I>wildargs.obj.</I> Zortech's version is called <I>_MAINx.OBJ</I>, where the <I>x</I> refers to the model.<P>
