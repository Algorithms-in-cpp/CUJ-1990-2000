<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0080_0033">Liant Ships C++/Views v3.0 Visual Programming Tool<A name="0080_0033"></FONT></h4></P>
Liant Software has begun shipping their C++/Views v3.0 Visual Programming Tool. C++/Views v3.0 is an object-oriented development tool that provides support for creating and porting GUI applications among Microsoft Windows, OS/2 Presentation Manager, OSF/Motif, Apple Macintosh, and DOS character mode environments. C++/Views v3.0 combines 100 ready-to-use classes with programmer productivity tools. C++/Views v3.0 includes interface, data, event, printer, and extended GUI classes. With C++/Views, programmers can create native GUI applications because C++/Views uses the local GUIs toolkit.<P>
C++/Views v3.0 includes a visual development tool, called C++/Views Constructor, which lets developers work visually with the C++/Views class library. Constructor unites a visual interface builder with an enhanced C++/Views Browser, letting users switch between drawing and archiving their portable resources to editing code which calls these resources.<P>
The C++/Views Interface Builder is a WYSIWYG editing tool for designing and testing the behavior of portable resources such as binary files of bitmaps, dialogs, and menus, or other GUI objects. Portable resources are called from an application at run-time. The same resource file can be called from a Windows, Motif, Presentation Manager, Macintosh, or DOS application, and will have a "look and feel" consistent with the host environment under which it runs.<P>
Other features of C++/Views v3.0 include geometry management and C++/Views Browser v3.0. The Browser is an MDI application which lets users cut-and-paste among multiple C++ applications. C++/Views v3.0 ranges from $499 to $1,999 depending on platform. There are no royalties or run-time fees. Upgrades range from $149 to $279 depending on platform.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0080_0034">Borland Announces ObjectWindows for Novell's AppWare<A name="0080_0034"></FONT></h4></P>
Borland International Inc. has announced that it will combine its ObjectWindows Library (OWL) with Novell's AppWare Foundation technology to provide developers with C++-based, cross-platform development libraries. Borland's ObjectWindows is a set of class libraries for developing applications in C++ that provides a set of pre-made objects for developing Windows Applications. The Novell AppWare Foundation is a set of C libraries that provide developers cross-platform functionality across multiple operating systems, graphical interfaces and network services. ObjectWindows for AppWare will let developers of applications for Microsoft Windows move their applications to Apple's Macintosh, IBM's OS/2, and UNIX platforms.<P>
ObjectWindows for AppWare is based on ObjectWindows v2.0. ObjectWindows 2.0 is a Microsoft Windows specific implementation of the ObjectWindows application framework. ObjectWindows for AppWare replaces the Microsoft Windows specific implementation with the AppWare Foundation cross platform API. The result lets the application run on Microsoft Windows, Macintosh, UNIXWare, SunOS, and HP-UX.<P>
An Early Experience Program is planned for the first quarter of 1994, and both companies plan to begin distributing ObjectWindows for AppWare in the summer of 1994.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0080_0035">The Haley Enterprise Ships Rete++<A name="0080_0035"></FONT></h4></P>
The Haley Enterprise has begun shipping Rete++, a new product that integrates rule-based programming with C++. Rete++ supports rule-based expert system development by providing rules that match against C++ objects using the Rete Algorithm.<P>
Rete++ provides both forward and backward chaining, and includes a comprehensive class hierarchy for convenient development of rule-based C++ applications. Rete++ generates C++ class taxonomies for use in C++ applications, creating C++ header files with class definitions. Rete++ also generates a class for each type of object that an application references in any rule. C++ applications can use the Rete++-generated classes directly or can further subclass them as needed.<P>
With Rete++, an application can assert facts either via the rule-based <I>deffacts</I> statement or directly from C/C++, C++ operator overloading allows elements to be expressed using standard C++ syntax, eliminates coding of complex, type-specific conditional logic, and reduces the need for operation-specific function names. Rather than invent a strongly-typed C++-like syntax for rules, Rete++ retains the traditional parenthesis delimited OPS5/ART/CLIPS/Eclipse syntax.<P>
Rete++ supports Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Windows NT, SUN Solaris, NeXTStep, Apple's Macintosh, and HP-UX. For more information contact <I>The Haley Enterprise, Inc., 413 Orchard St., Sewickley, PA 15143, (412)967-1100;FAX:(412)741-6457</I>.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0080_003E">FSI Announces HyperC Compiler<A name="0080_003E"></FONT></h4></P>
Fortunel Systems, Inc. (FSI) has announced a compiler for a new, portable data-parallel language, HyperC. HyperC was built as an extension to C that allows programmers to express the parallelism of an application, and run the application on (massively) parallel systems. HyperC was designed with the goals of efficient expression and compilation of parallel programs across different architectures. Constructs in the language emphasize: increasing local computation, minimizing communication requirements, and overlapping communications with computations.<P>
Data parallelism is achieved by applying the same operation across all the elements of a data set. HyperC provides "collections" as data sets for data parallel operations. Given overloading of operations and functions, a compact syntax can express data parallel computations. As an extension to C, HyperC supports incremental parallelization of existing C programs.<P>
HyperC is available for workstations including Sun, SGI, HP, and DEC. A PVM version is being developed and is planned for release by the end of March, 1994.
