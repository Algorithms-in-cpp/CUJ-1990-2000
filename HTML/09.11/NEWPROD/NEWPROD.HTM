<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="026C_0149">STEP Engineering Introduces Emulator For SPARC Architecture<A name="026C_0149"></FONT></h4></P>
STEP Engineering, Inc. ended a joint development project with Fujitsu Microelectronics by introducing the STEP Excell-930 for the Fujitsu SPARClite platform &#151; the first emulator for the SPARC architecture. The Excell-930 offers 40 MHz operation, debugging features, high-speed download, an emulator command interface, cache trace, and non-intrusive operation for the Fujitsu MB86930 SPARClite microprocessor.<P>
Features of the STEP Excell-930:<P>
<UL><li>Non-intrusive operation up to 40 MHz</li>
<li>Cache execution trace</li>
<li>8K trace buffer</li>
<li>Hardware and software breakpoints</li>
<li>user-defined external inputs</li>
<li>Logic analyzer interface</li>
<li>Microtec Research XRAY souce level debugger interface</li>
<li>Remote debugging from the Sun 4</li>
<li>System expansion bus for extensibility</li>
<li>Non-intrusive operation up to 40 MHz</li></UL>
To accommodate the high speeds of the SPARClite processor, the Excell-930 employs a design concept that repartitions the debug elements with a non-intrusive user command program, an advanced incircuit emulator cable, and all the links necessary for advanced real-time hardware and high-level debug. This approach makes it possible to control the system without introducing any wait states or buffer delays.<P>
The target SPARClite processor remains in the system eliminating induced interference from high-speed signals traveling along the cable. While the system executes code, the Excell-930 passively monitors all SPARClite bus activity and records it in the 8K deep trace memory.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="026C_014A">Software Development Toolkit<B></B> <B></B>For MELPS 7700 Microprocessor<A name="026C_014A"></FONT></h4></P>
Microtec Research, Inc. has released the first integrated software development toolkit for the MELPS 7700 microprocessor from Mitsubishi Electric Corporation. Microtec Research based the software tools upon its field-proven compiler and debugger technology and has developed additional code optimization technology to take advantage of the MELPS 7700 architecture.<P>
The MELPS 7700 toolkit consists of MCCM77, an optimizing ANSI C Cross compiler; XRAYM77, a source level debugger based upon Microtec Research's popular XRAY debugger; and ASMM77, an assembler with a linker and librarian. The components of the toolkit are designed to function together as an integrated whole and provide a superset of features found in typical development tools. The MCCM77 C Cross Compiler is a globally optimizing ANSI C standard compliant compiler. It generates code optimized for the MELPS 7700 architecture and emits debugging information necessary for use with the XRAYM77 source-level debugger. The ASMM77 Cross Assembler package converts MELPS 7700 compatible assembly language source programs into relocatable object code, integrates separately compiled modules into a composite executable module, and provides a management facility for independently developed modules.<P>
XRAYM77 is based on Microtec Research's XRAY debugger technology. It provides both C and assembly language debugging for MELPS 7700 users. Unique to XRAYM77 is its ability to debug optimized code in a non-intrusive manner giving software developers access to production quality code and leading to smoother hardware/software integration in embedded systems. It provides a window-oriented debug environment, allowing the user to step through and simultaneously view source code, continuously monitor variables and expressions, trace procedure function calls, and set simple and complex breakpoints. Program execution environments for the XRAY77 source level debugger include an instruction set simulator and a hardware emulator.<P>
Microtec tools run on PC compatibles, SPARCstations, Sun-3 workstations, and HP9000/300s. US list price for the complete toolkit starts at $2325 and includes the Cross Compiler, Assembler with linker and librarian, and source level debugger.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="026C_014C">Cache Trace<A name="026C_014C"></FONT></h4></P>
STEP's experience with high-speed microproccessor applications enabled STEP to develop proprietary technical circuitry to allow a full cache trace of the execution stream for SPARClite programs. In particular, the Excell-930 reconstructs programs executing from the on-board instruction and data cache memories in the SPARClite by using all the control information supplied by the processor and the special SPARClite emulator bus, then integrating this information with bus and control information.<P>
The ability to reconstruct execution with the cache on provides a distinct advantage for software designers debugging code executing in the 4K of total on-chip instruction cache.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="026C_014D">Excell-930 Command Interface<A name="026C_014D"></FONT></h4></P>
The emulator control interface provides a complete, low-level interface to the SPARClite processor. With the Excell-930, the designer is able to set breakpoints, patch, assemble in memory, start, stop, step and examine memory and registers.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="026C_014E">Reduces Time To Market<A name="026C_014E"></FONT></h4></P>
Recognizing that time is crucial to any development schedule, STEP designed the Excell-930 with many features that reduce development time. A high-speed download facility is supplied by utilizing a parallel interface. Download times now are significantly faster, as much as 5 to 1 over any serial implementation.<P>
To accelerate hardwaree debug, the Excell-930 also includes unique hardware debug features that allow the systems designer to bring up initial hardware requiring nothing more than correct power and a clock to begin. These hardware features consist of several target system tests, predefined scope loops, trigger in/trigger out, logic analyzer interface and 32 external inputs.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="026C_014F">Multiple Breakpoints<A name="026C_014F"></FONT></h4></P>
The Excell-930 supports 16 software and five hardware breakpoints, including instruction address, data address/data value and external. The hardware breakpoints will trigger on data range conditions, specifically breaking on data write values out of range. There are two data address breakpoints which allow breaks on load data and/or store data or on don't cares, two instruction address breakpoints, and one configurable external breakpoint.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="026C_0150">Remote Debugging<A name="026C_0150"></FONT></h4></P>
By providing the Excell-930 with an Ethernet connection, STEP Engineering solves the remote debugging needs of software engineers and enables them to work from the convenience of their offices. The Ethernet connection also improves productivity and performance by operating in workstation environments, including Sun 4 systems.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="026C_0151">High-Speed Download<A name="026C_0151"></FONT></h4></P>
Larger programs being coded today require faster system loading. By utilizing high throughput of the parallel bus and high-performance download software, the Excell-930 improves productivity by alleviating the burden of long download times.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="026C_0152">Source Level Debugger Interface<A name="026C_0152"></FONT></h4></P>
An interface to the XRAY source level debugger allows debugging of optimized C code in a windowed environment. XRAY is a cmpletely featured debugging environment with a large installed base as testimony to its capabilities as a superior debugger. It provides full breakpoints capabilities with a macro facility to allow conditional breakpoints and to patch code at the C source level. It offers data watch, register, and stack viewports along with an interleaved source and assembly viewport for easily correlating the C source to the compiler generated assembly code. This popular debugger provides a back door to emulator functions for displaying the trace and setting hardware breakpoints among other functions without losing position within the debugger.<P>
When coupled with the compiler, assembler, and source level debugger from Microtec Research, the Excell-930 provides a complete development platform for real-time embedded control applications.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="026C_0157">A WYSIWYG Screen Designer<A name="026C_0157"></FONT></h4></P>
Greenleaf Software has released version 2.0 of Greenleaf MakeForm, a flexible form design tool for user interface applications. MakeForm allows programmers to create Greenleaf DataWindows compatible data entry screens by "painting" a form and defining its attributes in a WYSIWYG fashion. A programmer can create forms without doing any programming. The data entry screens are written to a resource file which is read by DataWindows to create a form. The form can be modified by MakeForm, rewritten to disk, and accessed by DataWindows without any changes to code.<P>
The MakeForm user is provided with a menu-driven environment that supports the mouse and has a tool palette and status bar that can be hidden if desired. The programmer can customize the MakeForm environment by changing color attributes for the menu, tool palette, dialog boxes and message boxes as well as setting and resetting processing options. "Hot keys" are provided for most menu items. Key bindings of hot keys are also user definable through the Customize MakeForm feature. Dialog boxes and list boxes are used when defining the following form objects: PROMPTS, FIELDS, ATSAYS, MEMO FIELDS, TICKER-TAPE FIELDS and SCROLLABLE SUB-FORMS. General form editing features are included for defining physical and logical window size, frame and background attributes, screen clear characters, frame and linedraw characters, and default field flags.<P>
With MakeForm 2.0, the user can create elaborate form backgrounds with flexible color and character selection, plus a special linedraw mode gives one the ability to customize screens. Three forms can be defined concurrently with cut, copy to and paste from scrap to interchange form elements. Copying, deleting, moving and editing an object or multiple objects is accomplished by simply selecting the object or multiple objects with a click of the mouse or the push of a key. Form templates can be created and saved which allows the programmer to establish a base for each new form created. By customizing the templates, the programmer can produce a library of forms that can be easily accessed.<P>
The user has the ability to define up to four titles for forms and specify title justification and color attributes. By defining form shadows and specifying its orientation, shadow character and color attribute, a 3-D effect can be realized. The capability to compose a user defined attribute set on an individual form basis or as the default attribute set is provided also.<P>
Prototyping your forms is easy since MakeForm 2.0 allows the programmer to immediately execute the font being defined for a test run of its data entry functioning. This institutes all the necessary structures for DataWindows data entry processing. Changes can be made to the form as a result of the testing without ever leaving MakeForm. The programmer may also create an ASCII description of the contents of the form that can be written to disk and later printed.<P>
Once a form has been created using MakeForm, the form can be saved to disk as a resource file. This file can be optionally compressed using a proprietary, compression algorithm that is included with MakeForm. DataWindows <I>readtran()</I> function reads the form description in the resource file to create a form that can be used for a customer's data entry needs. <I>readtran()</I> has various options which allow you to choose only portions of the resource file, such as using only a subset of the fields contained in the file, using a different window than the one described in the file, or using a different set of attributes than the one contained in the file. <I>readtran()</I> has been enhanced so it can read compressed resource files.<P>
MakeForm 2.0 provides a conversion utility to convert form files created by MakeForm 1.0 to the MakeForm 2.0 format. Online context sensitive help is included along with a complete reference manual. A comprehensive tutorial is also included. Form files made with MakeForm 2.0 will be compatible for all Greenleaf DataWindows platforms.<P>
Greenleaf MakeForm 2.0 is available immediately for S249. MakeForm 1.0 users may purchase an upgrade for $80 by calling Greenleaf Software, Inc.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="026C_0158">Interactive Releases Architext<A name="026C_0158"></FONT></h4></P>
Interactive Software Engineering has released ArchiText, the language-driven document constructor designed to write and maintain structured documents. It is one of the first products ever produced using purely object-oriented programming techniques.<P>
ArchiText is a powerful high-level tool for manipulating and viewing structured documents, such as programs, specifications and technical or administrative reports. It was designed to relieve computer users from the need to worry about language structures.<P>
ArchiText features a Graphical User Interface, based on the Motif GUI standard, which makes it possible to manipulate complex structures quickly. A simple mouse click selects a structural block of a document; commands such as "cut", "copy" and "paste" apply to entire structures, instead of acting just on streams of characters as in textual editors.<P>
ArchiText caters to the needs of both beginning and advanced users of a programming language or other notation. Structures can be built both from system-generated templates, a favorite with inexperienced users, or simply by typing partial or complete phrases which are then parsed and completed by ArchiText's sophisticated built-in parser.<P>
A unique feature of ArchiText is its ease of adaptation to any context-free language. You can build an ArchiText editor for a specific language (programming language, design language, or even the description of the structure of standardized technical documents) by describing the language's grammar in a simple notation called LDL (Language Description Language). The standard delivery of ArchiText includes basic LDL grammars for Eiffel, Ada, FORTRAN, and C. Users have access to these grammars and may adapt them to support their specific needs, and may develop their own quite simply. This makes ArchiText a useful tool to support variants of a language, such as enforcing local programming or documentation standards.<P>
ArchiText also provides semantic facilities for executing programs, even not completely refined ones, for software prototyping and program testing. For more information <I>contact Interactive Software Engineering, 270 Stork Rd, Suite 7, Goleta, CA 93117. (805) 685-6869.</I><P>
