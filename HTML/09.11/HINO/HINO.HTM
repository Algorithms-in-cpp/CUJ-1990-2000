John F. Jarrett has contributed a shareware version of "Compuer Engineering Service Mouse Tools Library with JoyStick Functions" (ver. 1.25). The library has over 50 functions that deal only with Microsoft compatible mice. These functions give you almost complete control over mouse motion and sensing in all of your programs. In addition, the library also includes joystick functions which are hardly seen in C (BASIC provies, though). The joystick functions work with most all joystick game controllers that use the standard addresses starting from 200H. The functions sense button presses and X and Y movement on two joysticks with most all game adapters allow, some needing a "Y" cable. The distribution disk contains header files, documentation, the medium memory model compiled for Turbo C v2.0, Turbo C++, Borland C++, QuickC v1.0, Microsoft C v6.0, and Mix Power C v2.0, respectively. There is also a QuickBasic include file for using the C functions with QuickBasic and a couple of demostration executables and source. To obtain the source code, please contact the following address: P.O. Box 1222, Show Low, AZ 85901.<P>
