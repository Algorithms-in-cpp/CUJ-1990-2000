Contributed by William Giel (CT), WGCONIO Library is a set of text-windowing functions that emulate most of Turbo C's text windowing functions. Giel created the library after discovering that some of Turbo C functions didn't work when the application program was memory resident. The library provides box drawing, cursor manipulation, keyboard control, window manipulation, shadowing and text editing in windows. The disk includes C source code, documentation, a sample program and small-model library. Although the library was developed using Turbo C v2.0, it should be compilable using other C compilers by replacing <I>int86()</I> calls with the corresponding routines of your compiler.</FONT></FONT><P>

Ismail Zia (U.A.E.) has contributed a shareware VGA graphics library. The library contains routines for filling a region with specified pattern and color, setting up a view port, drawing an area bigger than the physical screen, saving and loading a screen image, drawing a rectangle, ellipse, polygon, line and arc with specified line style and color, special screen effect, clipping, stroked font manipulation, transforming, scaling, and rotating an object, etc. The program works on VGA standard modes and some extended modes. The distribution disk includes a huge model library for Microsoft C v5.0 or later and a large model library for Zortech C/C++ v2.0, documentation that describes all the functions in the library, demo animation image files, programs, and batch files, font files(8,16 points bit-mapped and stroked), and executable stroked font editor. Since the program was developed in C and 80386 Assembly (not included in the distribution), it will run under MS-DOS only on a 386 machine.<P>

Submitted by Jan Schumann (SoftC Ltd.), SoftC Database Library v2.0, a shareware package, provides 120 functions for fully compatible access to dBASE III/III+ data, memo, and index files, dBASEIV data files, Clipper, and Foxbase index files. Those functions support routines; read/write data files, delete/recover deleted records, manipulate I/O buffers, retrieve information about the record structure, data field manipulation, find key, move key to next/previous record, add/delete keys, retrieve current key, build key, data and time conversions, calculation, and validation, record locking, etc. The distribution disk includes complete documentation, header file, demo programs, and small memory model libraries for Turbo and Microsoft C.
