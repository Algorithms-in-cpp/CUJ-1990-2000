<BLOCKQUOTE>
The standard C++ <I>string</I> class is a low-level class that contains most of the functionality found in the standard C library's <I>string.h</I>. The string class's key advantages are automatic memory management and the syntactic convenience of overloaded operators. Also, under the current definition, a C++ string may also contain embedded null bytes.<P>
I will not publish the entire string class here. I include only the subset needed to implement the <I>bitstring</I> class (see <A href="list1.htm">Listing 1</a>, <A href="list2.htm">Listing 2</a>, and
<A href="list3.htm">Listing 3</a>)
. Missing from my listing are functions such as <I>insert, remove, replace</I> and comparison operations. Mine is a straightforward "cloning" implementation, which makes a separate copy whenever one string is constructed from another (as opposed to a reference-counting scheme which copies only when a string is modified &#151; see Chapter 3 of Jim Coplien's <I>Advanced</I> C++). I also do not allow embedded nulls in a string.<P>
