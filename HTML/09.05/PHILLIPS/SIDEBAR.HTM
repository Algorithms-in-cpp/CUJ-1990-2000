Taking photographs of a CRT can be frustrating, but it is possible if you keep a few tips in mind. Set up your display. Put your camera on a tripod and center the display in your viewfinder. Focus carefully and be sure your camera and display are level and aligned squarely. Your CRT refreshes or redraws the picture 60 times a second. If your shutter speed is faster than 1/60th second, then your photograph will have a mysterious slanted line on it. That is a picture of the partial screen refresh. Set your shutter speed no faster than 1/30th second. You may also have problems with a bright subject displayed on a dark background. Different cameras have different ways of dealing with this situation. Look at your owner's manual. The key is to let less light into your camera than normal. Experiment and expect to fail a few times before you get it right.<P>
