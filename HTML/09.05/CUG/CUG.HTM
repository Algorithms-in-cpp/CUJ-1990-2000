<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0121_009D">CUG163 Small C for MS-DOS<A name="0121_009D"></FONT></h4></P>
Don Lang (NY) has modified the code so that two-dimensional array can be used in input C source code for the compiler.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0121_009E">CUG220 Window BOSS<A name="0121_009E"></FONT></h4></P>
Revision 01.07.91 of the Window BOSS, a shareware windows package from Star Guidance Consulting is now being distributed. New features include support for Microsoft C v6.00A and TopSpeed C. This release also incorporates several other minor enhancements and a few esoteric bug fixes. Because of the volume of programs and its MS-DOS nature, the distribution disk contains MS-DOS-specific archived files.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0121_009F">CUG326 SoftC Database Library<A name="0121_009F"></FONT></h4></P>
Soft C, Ltd has provided the v2.10 update of SoftC database library (shareware package). New features include the support for dBXL, Quicksilver data and FoxPro memo files, functions added to perform record I/O with users structures, object code libraries for Zortech C++, and Turbo C/C++ and Microsoft Quick/Professional C.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0121_00A1">CUG340 C-Window<A name="0121_00A1"></FONT></h4></P>
Josef Ebnet (Germany) has submitted, a shareware package of interactive screen format generator, C-Window 3.0. C-Window provides a user-interface editor that creates windows, popup/pulldown menus, variable-length data entry fields with user-specified attributes. The editor generates C source code corresponding to the screen that the user created. You can compile the output C source code under Microsoft/Quick C, Turbo C or Lattice C. C-Window also offers mouse, printer and color display support. The distribution disk includes the form editor, sample programs and small model object modules for Microsoft/Quick C, Turbo C, and Lattice C.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0121_00A2">CUG341 Orbit Propagation<A name="0121_00A2"></FONT></h4></P>
Rodney Long (MD) has submitted several orbital mechanics utilities: a two-body, Keplerian orbit propagator that uses the universal variables method, a solver for Kepler's equation, a conversion routine for converting between true and eccentric anomaly, a conversion routine for Keplerian to Cartesian coordinates, a conversion routine for Cartesian to Keplerian elements, plus period, semi-latus return, true, and eccentric anomalies. They are all provided for educational purposes. The disk includes all the source code, MS-DOS executable code, input test data, and the resulting output data. The program was developed and compiled using Microsoft C v5.1.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0121_00A3">CUG342 I8255 Interface Library<A name="0121_00A3"></FONT></h4></P>
Blake Miller (AL) has submitted a collection of routines for digital I/O using a Computer Boards Inc. CIOAD-16 or a Metrabyte PIO12 compatible digital I/O board containing at least one Intel 8255 Programmable Peripheral Interface integrated circuit. The functions include initialization of data space, configuration, clear/read/write the bytes in the 8255, etc. He has also provided a more general and advanced digital I/O library. The disk includes all the source code for the library, small/medium/large model library, make files, and test/demo programs. His article appeared in the Feburary 1991 issue of <I>TECH Specialist</I>.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0121_00A4">CUG343 C Image Processing System<A name="0121_00A4"></FONT></h4></P>
Dwayne Phillips (VA) has provided the source code and TIFF (Tag Image File Format) files for the C image processing system (CIPS). The story has been appearing in the magazine since the March 1991 issue. CIPS is a small system that combines image processing operaters with a simple user interface. The source code is compiled using Microsoft C 6.0. Although certain display manipulation calls are unique to Microsoft, the substitution of these calls with equivalents from other C compilers, such as Turbo C, is possible.<P>
