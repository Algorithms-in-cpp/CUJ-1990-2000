Suppose you want to determine the area <I>A</I> under the curve <I>y = f(x)</I> between <I>x = a</I> and <I>x = b</I>. An analytic solution to this problem would find an antiderivative <I>F(x)</I> for <I>f(x)</I>. Then, using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, you find the desired area by evaluating the exact mathematical expression for the solution given by<P>
<pre>A = F(b) - F(a).</pre>
Provided that <I>f(x)</I> is simple enough for you to calculate the antiderivative, you can use this method. In many real-world problems, however, <I>f(x)</I> is too complex to antidifferentiate. You then apply a numerical method. In the example above, you may approximate the area by the Trapezoidal Rule, for example:<P>
<pre> A* = h*{.5*y(0) + y(1) + y(2)
+ ... + y(n-1)
+ .5*y(n)).</pre>
Instead of calculating <I>A</I>, for which we have no expression that we may numerically evaluate, we calculate <I>A</I>*, an approximation to <I>A</I>. (In the above example, I divided the interval <I>[a,b]</I> into <I>n</I> sub-intervals, each of width <I>h</I>, and drew a trapezoid lying under <I>y = f(x)</I> in each sub-interval. <I>y(i)</I> is <I>f(a+i*h), i=0,...,n,</I> the height of the left-most altitude of the <I>i</I>th trapezoid. <I>A</I>* is the sum of the areas of the trapezoids which lie under the curve <I>y = f(x)</I>. See <I>An Introduction to Numerical Analysis</I> <a href="long.htm#ref2">[2]</a> or any introductory numerical analysis text.)<P>
In both cases, the goal is the same &#151; evaluate the integral of <I>f(x)</I> over <I>[a,b]</I>. The methods, however, are different. In the first case, you have an exact mathematical formulation for the solution. In the second case, you must live with a formulation that is only an approximation to our goal.<P>
In both case, of course, the final answer is subject to the numerical error that finite-precision calculating machines introduce.<P>
