<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="011F_009B">Rational Systems Offers New Version Of Instant-C<A name="011F_009B"></FONT></h4></P>
Instant-C v5.0 from Rational Systems allows programmers to develop high quality code by complementing any production compiler with an integrated development environment that reduces the traditional edit-compile-link-test cycle to an edit-test loop.<P>
The new version offers several other new features, including a menu and multi-window user interface with mouse support. The new interface allows users to get started with Instant-C quickly. The interface retains a command window, which allows experienced users to use commands rather than menus.<P>
Instant-C now supports the use of external editors as well as adding keystroke emulation for Wordstar, Brief, or Emacs to the Instant-C editor. The editor can now handle large programs, and with the addition of multiple windows, to view and edit multiple files and functions.<P>
Instant-C augments the use of traditional compilers and debuggers during the developing phase of an application. It eliminates compile and link delays using incremental compiler and linker technology. Instant-C includes source-level debugging, interactive C expression evaluation, including macros, cross-referencing, browsing, single function or partical program execution and compatibility with Microsoft C.<P>
Version 5.0 will sell for $795. Existing customers can obtain Instant-C v5.0 for $50. All customers who received Instant-C after Dec. 15, 1990 will receive an upgrade at no charge. For more information, <I>contact Rational Systems, 220 North Main St., Natick, MA 01760, (508) 653-6006; FAX (508) 655-2753</I>.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="011F_009C">Watcom Compiler Reduces Code Size<A name="011F_009C"></FONT></h4></P>
The C/p16 compacting and optimizing compiler enables developers to substantially reduce memory requirements for application programs.<P>
C/p16 uses interpretive techniques at runtime to execute highly compacted 16-bit pseudo object code (p16 code). C/p16 will help developers facing memory constraints, such as the DOS 640K barrier, excessive paging under Windows or OS/2, or the hardware limits of embedded systems. It will also help those seeking larger application workspaces or smaller executable files.<P>
C/p16 employs a special version of the Watcom C compiler, which optionally generates either compact p16 code or optimized native 80x86 code. The p16 instruction-set architecture is optimized for compactness and fast interpretation.<P>
The C 8.0 optimizing compiler and tools package includes the WVideo debugger, linker, execution profiler, Make, and librarian. C/p16 is priced at $5,000, which includes an unlimited royalty-free license for runtime support. For more information, <I>contact Watcom, 415 Phillip St., Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, N2L 3X2, (519) 886-3700; FAX (519) 747-4971</I>.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="011F_009D">Lynx Offers Portable UNIX-Compatible OS<A name="011F_009D"></FONT></h4></P>
Developers can now create portable, hardware-independent applications that are UNIX-compatible using the LynxOS/MP. LynxOS/MP will also introduce a new multiprocessing architecture &#151; snugly coupled multiprocessing &#151; and support the industry's two existing architectures.<P>
Lynx optimized the snugly coupled multiprocessing (SCMP) version of LynxOS/MP to provide real-time performance. LynxOS/MP provides transparency and uniformity to the programmer, which increases portability of applications across uniprocessor and different flavors of multiprocessor systems. The architecture also satisfies the emerging trend toward flexible, modular computer systems, which may require multiple levels of computer interconnectivity.<P>
LynxOS/MP is source-compatible with UNIX System V.3 as well as BSD 4.3. It is binary-compatible with System V.3 and runs shrink-wrapped applications, including packages such as Wordperfect, Informix, and 20/20. LynxOS/MP complies with the IEEE POSIX 1003.1 standard and provides all the facilities defined in Draft 9 of the POSIX 1003.4 real-time extensions standards and Draft 3 of the 1003.4a threads standard.<P>
