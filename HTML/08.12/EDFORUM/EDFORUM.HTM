<A name="029F_0000"><A name="029F_0000">I write these words just after the first C Forum, sponsored by Boston University and The C Users Journal. One day of tutorials and three days of talks were given October 16-19 at BU's beautiful Corporate Education Center in Tyngsboro, Mass. (This pastoral site was formerly the Wang Institute, and a monastery before that. New England weather and foliage were on their best behavior.)<P>
Brian Kernighan delivered the keynote address. He spoke on "Programming Style in C," a refreshing update of material from our first book, <I>The Elements of Programming Style</I>. As always, Brian's presentation was at once entertaining and incisive.<P>
I served as conference technical chair. That gave me the opportunity to invite many old friends who I knew could speak well and had something to say. Our peerless publisher, Robert Ward, delivered both a talk and a tutorial. Other notables are literally too numerous to list exhaustively. I highlight only Larry Constantine, Rex Jaeschke, Tom Plum, and Jack Purdum as names that will be familiar to many. My personal payoff was the feedback from several attendees. They were quick to notice that the speakers were much better than average.<P>
This was the first time that <I>The C Users Journal</I> got seriously involved in sponsoring a major seminar. You, the readers of this magazine and the members of The C Users' Group, have long requested regular get-togethers. Given the success of this joint venture, I'm sure that you can look forward to additional seminars in the future.<P>
As for me, I don't expect to participate in another such conference anytime soon. Coming on the end of several weeks of meetings and talks, the C Forum left me exhausted. I also find that editing <I>The C Users Journal</I> soaks up much of my spare energy. (I enjoy the job, but it ain't always easy.) I will be spending calendar 1991 as a Visiting Professor in Sydney, Australia. Between teaching, writing, and editing, my time is well spoken for in the coming year.<P>
If you attended the C Forum, thanks for coming. If not, don't fret too much. You will see quite a number of the talks recast as articles here in the coming months.<P>
