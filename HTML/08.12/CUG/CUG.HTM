Contributed by Gary Osborn (CA), SE is a revision of the GED editor (CUG #199), which is itself a revision of the "e" editor (CUG #133). This version's enhancements and new features are:<P>
<UL><li>Uses up to 500K of RAM for text storage, while functioning with as little as a 6K of allocatable memory.</li>
<li>The virtual disk system's efficiency has been doubled by adding a stale page directory. The speed of disk reads has been improved.</li>
<li>An embedded <I>runoff</I> function will reformat internal text as per dot commands.</li>
<li>A <I>text push</I> stack has been added for pushing and popping lines.</li>
<li>The <I>undo</I> capability has been extended to include <I>redo</I>.</li>
<li>The program supports free cursor movement.</li>
<li>The command and display structure have been enhanced, but still retain Wordstar compatibility where feasible.</li></UL>
Many of the enhancements are cosmetic and do not affect the command structure, but they do improve the visibility and ease of use. The program was developed under Microsoft C v4.0. The distribution disk includes C source code, documentation, and an executable file.<P>

Written by Bjorn Larsson (Sweden) and submitted by Anders Thulin (Sweden), this volume includes the PCcurses v1.4 cursor/window control package. PCcurses offers the functionality of UNIX curses, plus some extras. Normally, you should be able to port curses-based programs from UNIX curses to PCcurses without making changes. PCcurses is a port and rewrite of Pavel Curtis' public domain <I>ncurses</I> package. All the code has been re-written &#151; it is not just an edit of ncurses (or UNIX curses). The disk includes C and assembly source code, user documentation, <I>makefile</I>s for various compilers, and a public domain <I>make</I> executable file. In addition, the distribution disks include some game programs such as stone, bugs, jotto, yahtzee, and others. Those programs are from CUG#101 and are modified by Anders Thulin to use the cursor routines. The program can be compiled under Microsoft C v3.0,4.0,5.1 or Turbo C v1.0, 2.0 or 68K Paragon C. MASM is required for the assembly file.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><P>

Bob Withers (TX) has modified the GNU version of AWK, gAWK. This AWK version provides all the features and functionality of the current UNIX AWK version, except for using pipes and user-defined functions. The program was developed under Microsoft C v5.1. and can be executed under MS-DOS and OS/2. The distribution disk includes C source code, Yacc source, <I>makefile</I>, user documentation, sample AWK programs, and AWK executable file. Yacc (CUG#285 BISON) is required to compile the Yacc source.</FONT></FONT><P>
