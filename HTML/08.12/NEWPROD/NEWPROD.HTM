<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="02A3_0182">GSS Supports UNIX Platform<A name="02A3_0182"></FONT></h4></P>
Graphic Software Systems has released a Graphics Development Toolkit (GDT) for UNIX in the Interactive -386/IX environment. Current releases of the GSS GDT support both DOS and OS/2 operating environments.<P>
UNIX GDT supports display devices through an X Window System driver and also offers a wide variety of hard copy device support. The DOS GDT and OS/2 GDT and UNIX GDT are source code compatible. Applications developed with one can be relinked using the other to operate in any of the environments.<P>
The toolkit provides a portable and device-independent graphics programming environment for PCs. With the GDT's device drivers, developers don't have to write code to support input, display, and hard copy devices.<P>
The UNIX GDT is now available from GSS and its distributors. The suggested list price is $995 and includes both 3½-inch or 5¼-inch disk formats. For more information, <I>contact Graphic Software Systems, 9590 SW Gemini Drive, Beaverton, OR 87006, (503) 641-2200; FAX (503) 643-8842</I>.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="02A3_0183">Softaid Introduces 68000 Emulator<A name="02A3_0183"></FONT></h4></P>
Softaid has introduced an in-circuit emulator for the 68000 microprocessor. A single emulator supports the 68000, 68008, and 68010 microprocessors.<P>
The emulator includes 131,072 hardware breakpoints that work at speeds up to 16MHz with no wait states. Breakpoints can be set on virtually any condition or machine cycle type. The user can set complex <I>IF_THEN</I> conditions up to five levels deep; breaks can thus be deferred until a highly specific sequence of events, involving different data value transfers, cycle types, and addresses, has occurred. A pass counter lets the user delay breakpoint execution for up to 65,536 cycles.</FONT></FONT><P>
The emulator includes a real-time performance analyzer that has 256 variable-width bins. The source-level debugger automatically sets the bins to exactly correspond to the user's C functions. After collecting performance data, a histogram identifies exactly how much time is spent in each routine.<P>
The 68000 UEM-Series emulator costs $5,995 and is available from stock. For more information, <I>contact Softaid, 8930 Route 108, Columbia, MD 21045-2101, (301) 964-8455; FAX (301) 596-1852.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="02A3_0184">StratosWare Introduces Debugging Package<B><A name="02A3_0184"></B></FONT></h4></P>
StratosWare Corporation has introduced a memory debugging package for C developers on the PC platform. The Memcheck product identifies the source file and line number of unfreed allocations, memory buffer overwrites and underwrites, and instances of invalid pointer usage.<P>
Memcheck also identifies out-of-memory conditions that can cause program crashes. For more intensive debugging efforts, the Memcheck libraries support calls to verify memory integrity and produce current memory allocation lists.<P>
Memcheck supports all memory calls for the Microsoft C and Borland Turbo C compilers for the IBM XT, AT, 386, 486, and compatibles. It requires four bytes of overhead per allocation at runtime. Installation on any project requires the addition of one <I>#include</I> per source file and linking with the appropriate Memcheck library; the package includes a "smart utility" for quick configuration of existing projects. Memcheck's allocation monitoring can be enabled or disabled at compile-time, at link-time, or at runtime.<P>
Memcheck is priced at $139.95. It is available from <I>StratosWare, 230 Collingwood, Suite 160, Ann Arbor, MI 48103, (313) 996-2944; FAX (313) 996-0966.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="02A3_0185">Perennial Wins ANSI/FIPS C Validation Award<A name="02A3_0185"></FONT></h4></P>
Perennial is a winner of the competitive procurement by the United States Government's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to provide a computer software test system for FIPS C.<P>
The proposed Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for programming language C will be based on a recently approved ANSI C Standard from the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Perennial will provide NIST with the certification test system used to validate conformance of implementations to the proposed FIPS C. The new standard will apply to C compilers acquired for federal use to allow portability of C applications across a variety of hardware configurations.<P>
The cornerstone for ACVS is Perennial's existing C Compiler Validation Suite, CVS-A, licensed worldwide since 1984. Origianlly, CVS-A was developed to provide testing of early C language implementations as well as the draft for ANSI C Standard.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="02A3_0186">Crystal Software Offers New Library<B></B> <B></B>Products<A name="02A3_0186"></FONT></h4></P>
In a joint effort, Crystal Software and Zortech have made availabe two new library products. Crystal Software was formed to help Lattice C users convert to another compiler safely and with minimal changes. The first product is the Lattice C Compatibility Kit, or LC-Port.<P>
LC-Port is a collection of libraries and header files that duplicate the features of the Lattice system libraries. The kit contains several hundred library functions from the system libraries and from the OS/2 simulation library. These functions are provided in object form for current versions of Borland, Microsoft, Watcom, and Zortech compilers. All object versions are in the same kit.<P>
The kit also contains Lattice-compatible header files that won't conflict with the header files from other compilers, macro files to simplify conversion of assembly language functions, and comprehensive documentation including guidelines for converting to each of the supported compilers. The Lattice Compatibility Kit is available for the single-copy price of $125 without source code.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="02A3_0187">Softaid Introduces 80386 Emulator<A name="02A3_0187"></FONT></h4></P>
A new in-circuit emulator for the 80386 microprocessor, the CodeStalker 386, is now available from Softaid.<P>
The CodeStalker suports full speed emulation at clock rates to 33MHz. No wait states are inserted or required, so it works non-intrusively even in systems designed with cache memory.<P>
The CodeStalker comes with a fiber optics communications link that downloads code at a sustained rate of more than 250K per second, essentially eliminating download delays. The unit is supplied with a short-slot fiber interface board for PCs.<P>
The CodeStalker includes four independent hardware breakpoints that can be set anywhere in the processor's 32-bit address space, in either RAM or ROM locations. Any number of software breakpoints can also be set. All run at full speed without injecting wait states. It provides a breakpoint input to stop emulation when an external hardware event takes place.<P>
CodeStalker sells for $9,995. For more information, <I>contact Softaid, 8930 Route 108, Columbia, MD 21045-2101, (301) 964-8455; FAX (301) 596-1852.</I><P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="02A3_0189">Symantec Sponsors Contest<A name="02A3_0189"></FONT></h4></P>
The Symantec Languages Programming Contest, sponsored by Symantec Corporation, is designed to provide a challenging incentive for students to be creative as they develop confidence in their technical abilities.<P>
The contest format consists of two sections. The first section contains three programming questions which require objective answers. The second section contains a challenging programming problem. The contest can be entered either by an individual or a group. There is a high school version of the questions and a more difficult college version. A panel of Symantec engineers has designed the contest questions and will also serve as the judging committee.<P>
The contest will run through the end of March 1991. Judging decisions will be made and prizes will be awarded in June 1991. Two grand prize winners will each win a $5,000 scholarship and a Macintosh llci system. In addition to the two grand prizes, the runners up will also receive prizes.<P>
