<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="023E_010F">First Byte Introduces MS-DOS Pro-Voice Speech Toolkit<A name="023E_010F"></FONT></h4></P>
First Byte announced ProVoice, a toolkit for adding synthesized speech to any MS-DOS computer application. ProVoice uses First Byte's SPEECH ENGINE to produce synthesized speech from strings of text, numbers, and data. ProVoice provides tools, examples, and sample source code for speech programming in C, Pascal, and Assembly.<P>
ProVoice synthesizes speech using a dictionary and grammar rules. Users can edit this dictionary to add words or alter pronunciation. ProVoice converts text to speech in two phases, using phonetic translation and pronunciation rules. The software analyzes and translates text into "sound descriptors", a phonetic language that can express pitch, duration, and amplitude codes to produce stress patterns in phrases and sentences. The second phase converts the intermediate phonetic language into speech signals.<P>
ProVoice supports a variety of sound boards, including Sound Blaster, AdLib, Covox Speech Thing, IBM ACPA card, Tandy sound system, PS/1 Audio Card, Street Electronic's Echo PC II, the IBM Speech Card, Sound Source from Disney, Hearsay 100, and the Sound Commander. ProVoice is priced at $595. <I>Contact First Byte Software c/o Davidson &amp; Associates, 19840 Pioneer Ave., Torrance, CA 90503, (310) 793-0600 ext. 230, FAX (310) 793-0601</I>.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="023E_0114">Expersoft Announces XShell Distributed Environment<A name="023E_0114"></FONT></h4></P>
Expersoft Corporation announced XShell, a portfolio of module-building toolkits and an object-oriented, distributed-system integration framework. XShell programs are encapsulated as software objects with a flexible, abstract interface, so that programs can be treated as extensible building blocks with standard interfaces. XShell's object-oriented module interfaces are written in C++ and provide transparent network communications between system building blocks. XShell modules see each other as though they were local software objects, though they may actually be running on separate computers, or even machines with completely different architectures.<P>
The XShell integrating framework supports the composition and control of cooperating systems of XShell modules, allowing system architects to dynamically distribute modules across a network, configure their communications pathways, and control the operation. XShell is primarily hosted on UNIX systems and uses common network protocols for communication. The X Window and Motif systems are used for all XShell graphical user interfaces.<P>
The XShell development framework also supports optional toolkits, such as rule-based systems, fuzzy logic, and genetic optimization and learning.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="023E_011D">FlashTek Enhances DOS Extender and Graphics Packages<A name="023E_011D"></FONT></h4></P>
FlashTek, Inc. has released X-32 and X-32VM, two DOS extenders, successors to its "DOSX" 32-bit extender that has shipped with the Zortech C/C++ compiler since July, 1991. FlashTek also announced enhancements to its Flash Graphics package, which has been shipping with Zortech compilers for nearly four years.<P>
X-32 includes a debugger interface allowing developers to do source level debugging with the existing Zortech debugger. <I>spawn(), exec()</I>, and <I>system()</I> functions are now available also. X-32VM is the same DOS extender as X-32, with the added feature of up to 3.5 GB of virtual memory. X-32 is compact &#151; for small programs, X-32 executables will be only about 15K larger than the equivalent large memory model 16-bit programs, while for larger programs, the X-32 executable size is often smaller than the equivalent large memory model 16-bit programs, due to the elimination of multiple instructions required for far pointers.<P>
Flash Graphics includes two separate libraries: a debug library and a smaller, faster standard library (only about 45K space required) for delivery. An interface module with source allows most BGI functions, except some initialization and palette functions, to work without modification using Flash Graphics.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="023E_011E">UNIX International Announces Debugging Specification<A name="023E_011E"></FONT></h4></P>
UNIX International (UI) has completed a specification for debugging tools that can analyze any UNIX system application. The specification (DWARF) allows debugging of any application generated by a compiler (C, C++, or Fortran 77) that supports the DWARF format, regardless of the applications vendor. The DWARF specification is the work of a UI SIG representing 70 organizations, including Data General, Fujitsu Limited, IBM, NER, NEC, the Open Software Foundation, Sun Microsystems, UNIX Systems Laboratories, and others.<P>
The DWARF format allows compilers to store complex debugging information in a compiled application. The goal of developing a standardized debugging format is to create a method for comunicating an accurate picture of how a compiled application relates to the original source. The DWARF format is open-ended and extensible, allowing the addition of new debugging information or support for additional languages, The format is not oriented toward any particular compiler or debugger design and can be used for platforms other than UNIX SVR4. After receiving industry input, UI will issue a revised format incorporating the developments of the review process.<P>
UNIX International is a not-for-profit international organization open to all parties interested in the evolution of UNIX System V and related software. The organization has over 260 members: manufacturers, software and system vendors, and universities. The DWARF specification is available free of charge by <I>calling UI at (800) 848-6495 or (201) 263-8400. Also, requests can be made by fax at (201) 263-8401 or by e-mail to s.mccarron@ui.org</I>.<P>
