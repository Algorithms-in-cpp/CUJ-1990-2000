<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0122_00B1">MetaWare Announces Embedded PowerPC Toolsets<A name="0122_00B1"></FONT></h4></P>
MetaWare Inc. has announced a series of four High C/C++ cross-platform toolsets for IBM's Series 400 family of PowerPC Embedded controllers. Each of the four toolsets includes a 32-bit compiler, linker, and assembler with eight levels of optimization. The toolsets are priced at $2,495 for Intel-based hosts, and $4,995 for IBM RS/6000, Sun, and HP-PA based hosts.<P>
The High C/C++ Cross Toolset provides host support for the following platforms targeted to the PowerPC embedded controllers: DOS and extended DOS on Intel X86 and Pentium, AIX 3.2 on RS/6000, SunOS 4.1 or Solaris on SPARCstation or equivalent, and HP-UX on HP-PA.<P>
The compiler is a C++ compiler rather than a C++ to C translator. MetaWare provides an "incremental strengths" feature with their compiler that permits migration from C to C++ in stages.<P>
The EA High C/C++ Toolset for Embedded PowerPC includes the following: big- and little-endian addressing, eight levels of global optimization, optional ANSI-standard conformance, extensive and scalable error/warning messages, a wide variety of compiler features through toggles and pragmas, floating-point code generation, C and C++ support, lint-like checking, source annotated assembly listings, inline functions across compilation units, no restriction on complexity of inlined functions, four user-selectable levels of warning messages, and support for ELF and DWARF.<P>
