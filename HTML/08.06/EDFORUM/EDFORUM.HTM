<A name="0169_0000"><A name="0169_0000">Earlier this year, we announced the first annual Bad C Pun contest. Our goal was to rid the world of all those terrible puns that seem to spring spontaneously from everyone who hears C mentioned.<P>
Response to the contest was great. We received over 100 entries. Stan Kelly-Bootle was gracious enough to serve as judge and jury. We announced the winners at Software Development '90, held in Oakland, CA, earlier this year.<P>
We want to emphasize that Stan chose the winning puns. I think you'll see why we make this point as you read through the "winners."<P>
Third runner up was from Robie MacRae, Somersworth, NH: "To C or not to C. That is no longer the question."<P>
The second runner-up pun hinted at the future of C. "From C to Shining C++", from Albert J. Grubis, Bedford, MA.<P>
The winning pun: "C-soned C programmers rely on their C-manship and The C Users Journal to avoid C-sickness," from John Cromer, Lincolnton, NC. (C why I wanted you to blame Stan.)<P>
Seven C-soned programmers received fourth place honors:<P>
"I came, I C'd, I conquered" by John Gardenier, Vienna, VA.<P>
"What did Bob Hope say after a malloc? 'Thanks for the memory' ", from Rick Knoblaugh, Houston, TX.<P>
"How much char could a char star star if a char star could star char", from Robert H. Dinah, Oakland, CA.<P>
"Cphylis: a computer virus which attacks weakened structures," from C. Kruchowy, Somis, CA.<P>
From Barry Combs, Denver, CO., "UNIX is Cnik".<P>
And this entry from Jeffrey R. Claus, Santa Monica, CA, was in the form of a dialogue:<P>
"Q: Are you a qualified programmer?<P>
A: Si.<P>
Q: Have you ever used the UNIX operating system?<P>
A: Si.<P>
Q: What languages have you used?<P>
A: Si."<P>
Can you believe we paid cash money prizes for some of these?<P>
Sincerely yours,<P>
Robert Ward, Editor/Publisher<P>
