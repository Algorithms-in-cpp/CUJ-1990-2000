Written by Gregory Pearson (CA) and submitted by Michael Yokoyama (HI), Microcom MNP C Library is a set of subroutines that implements the stream mode (Class 2) of the Microcom Networking Protocol (MNP) link protocol. MNP link protocol's stream mode works with MNP error-correcting modems or with other software implementations which use the Microcom MNP Library or other compatible software. The program is suitable for use with a Microsoft C application using the small code/small data model. The volume includes C and assembly source code for the library, a programmer's guide, and a sample terminal emulation program.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="016B_00C7">CUG315 FTGRAPH(Fast-Fourier Transform Graphics)<A name="016B_00C7"></FONT></h4></P>
Contributed by Thomas R. Clune (MA), FTGRAPH is a set of utilities for performing Fourier transforms and inverse Fourier transforms. The program also performs operations such as multiplication of data files, auto-power spectrum, crosspower spectrum, correlation from power-spectrum data, and filter time-domain real data. The result can be displayed on the monitor (<A href="fig1.htm">Figure 1</a>)
 or printer, or saved as an HPGL file.<P>
The minimal hardware requirements are: an IBM PC, XT, AT or clone, 256K or more RAM, MS-DOS or PC-DOS v2.0 or later. The program will use a math coprocessor (8087, 80287, or 80387) if present, but does not require it. The program supports Hercules, CGA, EGA, and VGA graphics cards. A Microsoft (or compatible) mouse can select an option from the menu. The disk includes a complete set of C source code including a mouse driver, documentation, and sample data files such as a 16-cycles square wave data, a gaussian waveform, a sine and cosine wave data, and a noisy Gaussian curve. The program was developed using Microsoft C v5.1 (large model). There are some Microsoft specific features. The program is copyrighted by Eye Research Institute.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="016B_00C8">CUG316 AS8 Cross Assembler<A name="016B_00C8"></FONT></h4></P>
Contributed by H.G. Willers, this volume includes a cross assembler for Z8 microprocessor. The assembler is based on the code of a cross assembler for a Z80 processor from DECUS and enhanced with a hashed symbol table and several bug fixes. The source code compiles under MS-DOS using Mark Williams Let's C (v3.0.2) and Quick'C (v1.01) and under System 5.3 UNIX for 68020 and Interactive UNIX for 386. The disk includes C source code, a users guide and test files.<P>
A reference of cross-assemblers in our library appears in <A href="tab1.htm">Table 1</a>.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="016B_00CA">CUG220 Window BOSS<A name="016B_00CA"></FONT></h4></P>
Phillip A. Mongelluzzo (CT) from Star Guidance Consulting has submitted Revision 02.15.90 of The Window BOSS and Data Clerk. This release includes support for Lattice C v6.0 and Zortech C v2.0. The Window BOSS now supports Microsoft, Borland, Lattice, Watcom, Mix Power C, Computer Innovations, Datalight, and Aztec C.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="016B_00CB">CUG243 DECUS C Preprocessor<A name="016B_00CB"></FONT></h4></P>
Robert Artigas Jr. (TN) has updated the DECUS C preprocessor to work under OS/2. The new version still compiles under MS-DOS.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="016B_00CC">CUG285 Bison For MS-DOS<A name="016B_00CC"></FONT></h4></P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="016B_00CD">CUG290 Flex<A name="016B_00CD"></FONT></h4></P>
Robert Artigas Jr. (TN) has updated Bison and Flex, with several minor changes and enhancements. The new release also includes an OS/2 executable. The programs now can be compiled under MS-DOS, OS/2 and UNIX systems.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="016B_00CE">CUG303 MC68K Disassembler<A name="016B_00CE"></FONT></h4></P>
We have recieved John M. Collins' (England) revision of the MC68K Disassembler via T.W. Kalebaugh (KS). The new version takes a COFF (Common Object File Format) object file as input and disassembles it.<P>
