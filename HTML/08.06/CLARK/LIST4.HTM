<pre>DateObjects can span dates from 1 January 4700 BC
to 31 December 25000 AD, or 10847738 days.

A good reference date is 23 May 1968
which should have a Julian date of 2440000.
If we call GetJulian() to make sure, we find
that it does, in fact, equal 2440000.

Attempting to add 10847738 days to 23 May 1968
yields a Bad Date.
Attempting to subtract 10847738 days from 23 May 1968
yields a Bad Date.
However, adding 10847738 days to 1 January 4700 BC
yields 31 December 25000 AD.

Today is 4-07-1993.
The next five days are:
