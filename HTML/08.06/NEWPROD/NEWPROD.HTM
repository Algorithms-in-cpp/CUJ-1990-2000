<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="016F_00C7">AT&amp;T Offers Research Version Of Their Concurrent C<A name="016F_00C7"></FONT></h4></P>
AT&amp;T's UNIX software operation has announced the general availability of a research version of Concurrent C Release 1.0 and of C++ Release 2.1.<P>
Concurrent C is a superset of C that is tailored for parallel programming. The language, designed and implemented at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories by Dr. Narain Gehani and Dr. William D. Roome, has been licensed until now only as research technology for universities and other research institutions.<P>
"We're expanding the availability of Concurrent C to help more programmers experiment with ways to write applications with parallelism for uniprocessor and multiprocessor systems," said Mike DeFazio, director of system software at the UNIX software operation.<P>
Concurrent C is the result of an effort to enhance C so that it can be used to write concurrent programs that can run efficiently on single computers, on loosely-coupled distributed computer networks, or on tightly-coupled distributed multi-processors. Concurrent C is an upward compatible extension to C and C++.<P>
Licenses for concurrent C are available in source code format from AT&amp;T's UNIX software operation on a 9-track tape in cpio and tar format. The current implementation assumes machines with a 32-bit word. It also assumes that the C compiler supports long identifier or "flex" names.<P>
From March 19 to July 31, 1990, educational institutions will be able to license Concurrent C for $700. The regular educational price is $1000.<P>
The C++ Language System Release 2.1 fixes bugs detected by developers and reported by customers since the release of R2.0 last June. The new release is accompanied by the version of the C++ reference manual that Bjarne Stroustrup has presented to the ANSI C++ committee. The C++ release is available to software vendors in source code for $25,000. Upgrades from Release 2.0 are $5000.<P>
Vendors who wish to license either product should contact the UNIX Software Operation in Greensboro, N.C., at (800) 828-UNIX, in London at (+44-1-) 567-7711, in Tokyo at (+813-) 431-3670, or in New Delhi at (+91-11-) 331-0513.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="016F_00C8">SMI Adds Design Tool To Better C<A name="016F_00C8"></FONT></h4></P>
Silico-Magnetic Intelligence has expanded its Better C product line with a design tool, Top-Down Designer (TDD). Better C is a program generator and suite of tools that support a structured design methodology.<P>
TDD isolates the design phase from logic programming. Once the design is complete, the parameters are passed to the Better-C generator, which generates either a module framework or function frame. The programmer codes the logic into the generated frame. Design data can be saved for future modification.<P>
The TDD package consists of a top-down design tutorial and the interactive designer. Contact Silico-Magnetic Intelligence, 24 Jean Lane, Chestnut Ridge, NY 10952. (914) 426-2610.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="016F_00C9">M++ Mathematical Class Library Now Supports Additional Types<A name="016F_00C9"></FONT></h4></P>
Dyad Software has released v2.0 of M++, a C++ productivity tool that eliminates the looping structures and memory allocation commands otherwise needed to create and manipulate arrays.<P>
The new version supports all character, integer and floating point arrays including complex. Version 2.0 also adds a dynamic memory management system that improves allocation speed while reducing or eliminating memory fragmentation problems. The new allocation tools work for both M++ and user-defined classes.<P>
M++ 2.0 also improves on the speed and extent of the previous version's math support.<P>
M++ is compatible with AT&amp;T C++ 2.0 compatible compilers and translators, including Zortech and Glockenspiel. The MS-DOS and OS/2 version is $295. Source code and UNIX, VMS and Apple versions are also available.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="016F_00CA">Library Supports Multi-Tasking<A name="016F_00CA"></FONT></h4></P>
A new software library, Divvy, allows programmers to design self-contained multi-tasking MS-DOS applications without resort to special realtime kernals or multi-tasking operating systems.<P>
Divvy supplies routines to create tasks, define task priorities, handle flags and queues, get and change system status, and interface hardware interrupt service routines into the multi-tasking system. Divvy can support "unlimited" tasks, flags, and queues &#151; system memory is the only limit on application size. Divvy includes multi-tasking versions of standard input and output routines, so that other tasks can execute while one task waits for operator input.<P>
Divvy uses a priority-based, non-preemptive scheduler, avoiding the need for re-entrancy and thus allowing applications to use standard libraries and MS-DOS calls.<P>
Price is $229. Contact Technical Sales, Drumlin, 1011 Grand Central Ave., Glendale, CA 91201 (818) 244-4600; FAX (818) 244-4246.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="016F_00CB">Magna Carta Adds 386 Support<A name="016F_00CB"></FONT></h4></P>
Magna Carta Software has added support for Watcom C 386 to its C Windows Toolkit. Watcom C 386 works with MS-DOS extenders and tools from both Phar Lap and Eclipse. The initial C Windows Toolkit upgrade works only with the Phar Lap tools. Magna Carta expects to add Eclipse support in about three months.<P>
The C Windows Toolkit user interface library supports the development of windows, help screens, popup menus and spreadsheet-style menus. Magna Carta has previously offered support for the 286 Watcom C compiler.<P>
The new version is $199.90; $99.95 as an upgrade. Contact Magna Carta Software, Box 475594, Garland TX 75047-5594 (214) 226-6909.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="016F_00CC">Greenleaf Upgrades Math Library<A name="016F_00CC"></FONT></h4></P>
Greenleaf has upgraded and renamed its decimal math library; Business MathLib has become Financial MathLib. Greenleaf claims the new version increases the speed of calculations by as much as 500 percent. Greenleaf has also added an on-line help system that gives users a pop-up, cut and paste, hypertex help system on-line. Greenleaf also provides help databases for the Norton Help Engine and the QuickC Advisor.<P>
In addition to precise decimal math, Financial MathLib provides functions to calculate loan amortization, internal rate of return on bonds, depreciation, and compound interest.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="016F_00CD">More Diagnostics In New Lint<A name="016F_00CD"></FONT></h4></P>
Release 4.0 of PC-lint, a source code analysis tool from Gimpel Software, adds 70 new diagnostic messages, better handling of library functions, and 30 new command line options.<P>
New diagnostics include checks for compile-time objects such as macros, <I>typedefs</I>, and declarations. PC-lint reports compile-time objects not used, both locally and globally; it will also point out header files not used, externals that can be made static, and declarations that can be offloaded from header files.</FONT></FONT><P>
These new diagnostics depend upon header files which have been designated "library". PC-lint doesn't expect library headers to be fully utilized, nor even defined. Version 4.0 also supports the notion of a <I>lint</I> object module which captures, in binary form, all the external information of a module or modules, allowing for incremental <I>linting</I> via a <I>make</I> file.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><P>
Version 4.0 includes seven new options to customize message suppression. UNIX-style options are also supported. Increased control over message format facilitates automatic filtering and processing (e.g. with an intelligent editor).<P>
Newly added "Elective Notes", will warn the programmer about silent type conversions caused by prototypes. The new version can also warn about name clashes occuring within the first "count" characters, inner declarations that hide outer declarations, and format/type inconsistencies.<P>
PC-lint runs under MS-DOS or OS/2 with a minimum of 196K. Price is $139. Contact Gimpel Software, 3207 Hogarth Lane, Collegeville, PA 19426 (215) 584-4261.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="016F_00CE">Major Microsoft Release Includes 'Workbench' Development Environment<A name="016F_00CE"></FONT></h4></P>
Microsoft has announced a major upgrade of its C Professional Development System. MSC 6.0 includes an integrated development environment, Programmer's WorkBench, an extensible foundation on which all tools are run. The environment supports the Source Browser, an optimized C compiler with new language features, and a redesigned and enhanced version of the CodeView debugger. Microsoft has also upgraded QuickC and QuickAssembler to be compatible with the Programmer's WorkBench environment.<P>
Microsoft claims that programs compiled with MSC 6.0 are typically seven to 10 percent smaller and 10 percent faster than with MSC 5.1.<P>
Programmer's WorkBench is an integrated development environment with an open architecture. Taking a project-centered approach, it integrates the editor, Source Browser project database, build and add-on tools, and CodeView debugger. The environment, which is identical under both MS-DOS and OS/2, remembers details and settings between sessions.<P>
Microsoft is publishing programming interfaces that will allow other vendors to offer tools that can seamlessly run in the Programmer's WorkBench environment. Sixty vendors have pledged to support MSC 6.0. (See accompanying story.)<P>
The new source browser allows programmers to interactively browse through a project database, reviewing the relationships and use of variables, functions, definitions and macros.<P>
The new release adds these language features:<P>
<B>Based Pointers</B>. Microsoft says that this new type of pointer combines the flexibility of a 32-bit pointer with the size and speed advantages of a 16-bit pointer.<P>
<B>Register-based parameter passing</B>. Programmers can now pass up to three parameters in registers.<P>
<B>In-line assembler</B>. The accompanying release of CodeView v3.0 can reside in extended memory, using as little as 20K on a 286 or better. With the new version, programmers can dynamically record and replay debugging sessions, including all input. Because CodeView runs as part of Programmer's WorkBench, it automatically saves all breakpoints, watch windows and other settings between sessions.<P>
MSC 6.0 requires MS-DOS v3.0 or higher or OS/2 v1.0 or higher and comes on both 5 1/4 and 3-1/2 in. disks. The package retails for $495; upgrades start at $125.<P>
