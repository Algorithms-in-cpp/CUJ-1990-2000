<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you just want to use a 80286 or better as a fast 8088, (in real mode, that is, since you need more advanced software tools than the ones presented here if you want to get into protected mode) you must be aware of some subtle differences in its reset process.<P>
When execution begins on a 80286 or higher, CS:IP will be F000:FFF0, just as for the 8088, but address lines 20 and higher will stay high <I>until</I> the first time the CS register is loaded. So execution begins at the top of the address space, but if you do a far jump, or otherwise cause CS to be loaded, you'll suddenly find yourself down in the first 1MB of address space! On most architectures, the ROM is reflected into the top of the 1MB address space by the address decode circuitry so that this isn't a problem. If your hardware doesn't reflect the ROM, then you should use only near jumps, initialize briefly, and use protected mode &#151; in fact you should get into protected mode as soon as possible.<P>
