<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="005C_0031">Rogue Wave Introduces DBtools.h++<A name="005C_0031"></FONT></h4></P>
Rogue Wave Software has introduced DBtools.h++, a library of foundation classes to support C++ programmers in creating SQL database applications. DBtools.h++ provides C++ components for object-oriented development on the client side, while retaining the benefits of their installed RDBMS. DBtools.h++ provides developers with a portable, cross-platform interface to SQL databases. This interface bridges the relational and object-oriented models by encapsulating fundamental relational constructs such as tables, rows, and cursors in C++ classes. Other features of DBtools.h++ include facilities for manipulating dates, times, strings, and in-memory data structures.<P>
DBtools.h++ consists of 36 public classes for encapsulating relation constructs and data types, plus 100 data structures and utility classes found in Tools.h++, which is integrated into DBtools.h++. DBtools.h++ also binds the basic data types available in relational database systems to its own higher-level C++ data structures. DBtools.h++ achieves portability across databases through a two-tiered architecture that includes a public interface and separate Access Libraries for the various supported databases. Because DBtools.h++ supports shared libraries, UNIX developers can switch between databases without relinking, just as Windows developers do with DLLs.<P>
DBtools.h++ supports ORACLE7, Sybase SQL Server, Microsoft SQL, and ODBC (Windows only). Prices for DBtools.h++ start at $395 for Windows and $495 for UNIX.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="005C_0037">AJS Publishing Introduces VBXpress<A name="005C_0037"></FONT></h4></P>
AJS Publishing, Inc. has introduced VBXpress Custom Control Design System. With VBXpress, a user can design original screen objects for Windows, such as custom sliders, tool bars, floating tool palettes, flyouts, rocker buttons, spin buttons, and graphic command buttons. VBXpress then turns the screen object control into a VBX custom control without programming. The resulting VBX controls can be used to add user-interface features to programs written in Visual C++, Visual Basic, Borland C++ 4.0, dBASE for Windows, or other VBX-conforming languages or application development systems.<P>
VBXpress creates VBX controls based on the definitions specified by the user through the Control Editor. The VBXpress Control Editor is a menu-driven, point-and-click program, which assembles image, color, text, behavior, and style selections into a screen object. Images can be applied from four available palettes or created new and imported from an external bitmap editor. The control can then be customized from a variety of available events and properties. When a new control's definition is finished, it is stored in a VBXpress resource file with a VBM extension. VBM files can be reopened later for modifications and additions. VBXpress will automatically generate the new VBX file containing the functionality of the newly-defined control. According to AJS, the resulting file is a fully-compatible, Level One VBX control.<P>
The VBXpress Custom Control Design System includes the Control Editor program, VBXpress Conductor wizard, documentation, and help system. The VBXpress Custom Control Design System is priced at $299.
