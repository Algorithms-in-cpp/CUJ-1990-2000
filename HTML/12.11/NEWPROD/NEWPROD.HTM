<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01E3_00FE">MetaWare Ships High C/C++ Compiler For Windows NT<A name="01E3_00FE"></FONT></h4></P>
MetaWare Incorporated has begun shipping its High C/C++ Version 3.2 Compiler for Microsoft Windows NT. High C/C++ is plug compatible with the standard Microsoft 32-bit software development kits. The High C/C++ compiler produces Microsoft Windows NT standard COFF object modules, as well as Microsoft NT standard CodeView-4 debugging information, so C++ debugging is available with CodeView-4-compatible debuggers including Microsoft's SDK Windbg and Visual C++ debuggers.<P>
High C/C++ Version 3.2 includes two C++ compiler features, EasyDLL and EasyThread. With EasyDLL, developers can flip a switch to export or import functions in a given block of code. EasyThread converts existing routines and programs to take advantage of Windows NT's multithreading capability. A developer can use stackable toggles in High C/C++ to turn on and off sections of code that use thread-local storage. Other features of High C/C++ include: "wrappable" header files outside the source code, class initialization control at a processwide level, and support for the three-level Microsoft scheme and other priority schemes.<P>
Included in High C/C++ is the Win32s Enablement Package, which lets 32-bit applications built with MetaWare's High C/C++ compiler for Windows NT run under Windows 3.1 and provides support for Intel's Pentium Processor and for Intel-based 32-bit Microsoft Operating Systems. High C/C++ Version 3.2 for Windows NT is priced at $595. Current users of High C/C++ can license High C/C++ version 3.2 for $495.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01E3_00FF">XVT Announces XVT-Architect<A name="01E3_00FF"></FONT></h4></P>
XVT Software Inc. has released XVT's Development Solution for C++ (DSC++) release 3.0. DSC++ 3.0 includes XVT-Architect, a visual programming tool, and XVT-Power++ with C++ application frameworks and Rogue Wave Tools.h++. XVT-Architect provides a graphical way to develop portable C++ applications. XVT-Architect offers GUI functions such as notepads, drag-and-drop palettes, toolbars, and tear-off palettes; and includes three modules: Blueprint, Drafting Board, and Object Strata. The Blueprint module is a browser used to view the object hierarchy of the XVT-Power++ application frameworks. The Drafting Board module is a graphical layout tool for the design of windows, menus, strings, and visual framework objects. The Drafting Board lays out and sets attributes of XVT-PowerObjects. The Object Strata module lets the user view the class inheritance of an object selected from either the Object Strata or Blueprint modules. XVT-Architect also generates application code. User code shells and GUI code are generated separately.<P>
In addition to Rogue Wave Tools.h++, XVT-Power 3.0 includes Portable Imager, Portable Native Font Access, and a Portable Hypertext Help System. Features of Portable Images include: graphic design of tool bars, palettes, and other bitmap images; full palette control and manipulation; and support for 24-bit color. Using a cross-platform font mapping mechanism, Portable Native Font Access eliminates the need for platform-specific coding of font control. Users are given access to font selection through the native system resource. Features of The Portable Hypertext Help Systems include: native help views, portable XVT help views, hypertext links, embedded graphics, font control, and context-sensitivity.<P>
The C++ data structures library, Rogue Wave Tools.h++, supports 100 classes for data, string, and character manipulation. Classes are provided for single- or double-linked lists, stacks, queues, vectors, sets, bags, sorted collections, ordered collections, dictionaries, and regular expressions for search and replace. The library also supports DDE on Windows 3.1.<P>
Licenses for XVT's Development Solution for C++ 3.0 are $1,950 for PCs and $6,300 for workstations. There are no additional user fees or royalties. Current XVT DSC++ customers on active maintenance will be upgraded at no cost.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01E3_0100">IDE's StP/OMT Supports Persistence<A name="01E3_0100"></FONT></h4></P>
Interactive Development Environments, Inc., and Persistence Software have announced that IDE's Software through Pictures for the Object Modeling Technique (StP/OMT) supports Persistence, a development tool that links objects to relational data. Together, Persistence and StP/OMT provide an object-oriented transaction processing solution that extends the underlying OLTP mechanisms of relational databases to objects.<P>
Persistence includes two products, the Persistence Relation Interface Generator (RIG), which automatically generates the interface between C++ classes and relational databases, and the Persistence Relational Object Manager (ROM), which manages databases transactions and locking. Users of STP/OMT can build links to relational data into their object model and automatically generate C++ classes to interface with relational database, including Oracle, Sybase, Ingres, and Informix. Because Persistence automatically generates SQL commands for creating and accessing relational databases, it can also be combined with STP/OMT object models to generate relational database models. Using StP/OMT, developers can design object models as well as database models for an application.<P>
STP/OMT is a tool that facilitates team development and supports the object-oriented development process, including requirement analysis, design, implementation, documentation, deployment, maintenance, and continuous development. StP/OMT is based on IDE's advanced code technology and supports multiple users in an open environment through a shared repository; version control and locking; consistency checking; inter-model navigation; and automatic generation of code, test cases, and documents.<P>
STP/OMT, bundled with Persistence, is priced at $12,000 per user license. Persistence is available from Persistence Software starting at $15,000 for the RIG and $3,000 for the ROM.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01E3_0103">Prominare Releases The Prominare Development System<A name="01E3_0103"></FONT></h4></P>
Prominare has released The Prominare Development System, a 32-bit visual design environment for creating GUI applications for OS/2, Windows 3.1, Windows NT, and for the IBM User Interface and the Computer Associates CommonView C++ class libraries. The Prominare Development System consists of three development tools: Prominare Designer, Prominare Builder, and Prominare Editor.<P>
Prominare Designer lets you design graphical applications, complete with menus, accelerators, strings, dialogues, custom resources, and a help table. Once the visual design is complete, Prominare Designer creates the required Resource Script and source language files. According to Prominare's release, an application consisting of a few menus and dialogues can be designed, native-code generated, and compiled within ten minutes without the developer writing a single line of C/C++ source code. Source code added by the developer is not overwritten &#151; as necessary, missing components are added. Other features of Prominare Designer include: testing of individual windows or dialogues, including the links between each; support for OS/2 Presentation Manager resources, including MMPM/2 and Pen for OS/2 controls; and importing of existing OS/2 and Windows 3.1 .RES files with automatic conversion of bitmaps, icons, and cursors to OS/2 PM equivalents where required.<P>
The second tool, Prominare Builder, lets developers access the tools used to compile, edit, and debug application programs on a point-and-shoot basis. Prominare Builder is a rule-based tool that lets the developer set compiling characteristics for the application without regard to the actual source languages that make up the application. Prominare Builder also lets the developer by-pass the need to construct batch files or intricate MAKE files with compiler switches. Prominare Builder supports the following: Borland C++ for OS/2; Microsoft C, FORTRAN, and Pascal; WATCOM C, C 386, C/C++32; Zortech C++; and other languages.<P>
The third tool, Prominare Editor, is a source code editor that creates and edits source language files. Prominare Editor works with Prominare Builder when Prominare Builder detects an error during a build session. Features of Prominare Editor include: error display and correction, multiple search and replace, Grep, and source analysis for uneven braces, parentheses, and quotes.<P>
The Prominare Development System is priced at $795. For more information contact Prominare Inc., 222 The Esplanade, Suite 618, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5A 4M8, (416) 363-2292; FAX: (416) 363-6157; CompuServe: 70363,1175; Internet: prominar@io.org.<P>
