<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0142_00C8">ParcPlace Ships MethodWorks 1.0<A name="0142_00C8"></FONT></h4></P>
ParcPlace Systems, Inc., has introduced MethodWorks 1.0, an analysis and productivity tool, which supports corporate developers in discovering the correct business objects for applications. Developers can describe business functionality in end-users' terms.<P>
MethodWorks consists of a set of tools to help developers perform accurate analysis to reduce coding errors and enhance productivity. The core of MethodWorks is its scripting tools, used to specify business functionality. The Script Editor lets developers create, link, and reuse scripts to capture and organize business logic. MethodWorks identifies potential objects as scripts are entered, and its specialized tools highlight common business modeling problems.<P>
MethodWorks complements existing CASE/modeling tools. Third-party tools that provide repository management, diagramming, and code generation can enhance ParcPlace's toolset when used in conjunction with MethodWorks. The product complements existing notation and methods, including those of Booch, Rumbaugh, and Jacobson. MethodWorks helps developers discover objects using ParcPlace's Object Behavioral Analysis (OBA) method. MethodWorks is written in VisualWorks, ParcPlace's client and server development tool based on the ParcPlace Smalltalk object-oriented programming language. MethodWorks can be used alone or in combination with VisualWorks.<P>
MethodWorks is shipping on Intel-based PCs under Windows 3.1 and Windows NT with a SunOS version planned for summer 1995. Windows systems are priced at $995, and UNIX-based systems are priced at $1,395. For more information contact ParcPlace Systems, Inc., 999 E. Arques Ave., Sunnyvale, CA 94086-4593, 800-759-7272 or +1-408-481-9090; FAX: +1-408-481-9095.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0142_00C9">MetaWare Announces DSOM Support<A name="0142_00C9"></FONT></h4></P>
The High C/C++ Toolset for OS/2 with DirectToSOM functionality now supports the distributed SOM (DSOM) technology. DSOM makes it possible to access SOM class objects across a network.<P>
"DSOM, designed by IBM Corporation, is a technology that handles creation and destruction of 'remote' objects," said Bennett C. Watson, MetaWare's president.<P>
Under DSOM, users of a remote object can syntactically pretend that they have a local object. This means that method calls can be written as if the object were local. Users are really operating on a DSOM-created local proxy of the remote object. A proxy is an instance of a class derived from the base class. Method calls on the proxy are redirected or "forwarded" to the remote object. Parameters are sent across the network to the remote object and return results are sent back. Users can compile C++ source code to directly create SOM-compatible binaries without having to write Interface Definition Language (IDL) descriptions of classes. The resulting SOM objects can interoperate with SOM objects written in other languages. The compiler can automatically generate IDL for C++ classes so that other SOM-supported languages that use IDL can interface with the classes.<P>
The toolset is priced at $595 per license. For more information contact MetaWare Incorporated, 2161 Delaware Ave., Santa Cruz, CA 95060-5706, +1-408-429-6382; FAX: +1-408-429-9273.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0142_00CC">Gimpel Software Releases C-Vision 4.0<A name="0142_00CC"></FONT></h4></P>
Gimpel Software has anounced the release of its software package, C-Vision v4.0. C-Vision v4.0 is a set of tools supporting the analysis, documentation, and maintenance of C and C++ source. The package consists of four main parts: a cross-referencer, a diagrammer for function-call graphs and class hierarchies, a source code reformatter, and an intelligent source code lister.<P>
The cross-referencer produces a listing of symbols with usage and type information. Usage includes definition, declaration, assignment to, and address of. Type information includes prototypes for functions and templates. All symbols, including macros, types, templates, and members are eligible for inclusion in the cross-reference, subject to suppression options. Cross-reference and tree information may be dumped in an ASCII format. The symbol count limit has been increased from 64 K to 4 Meg.<P>
The tree formatter provides various output formats to provide different code views. In addition to trees of function calls, C-Vision can produce trees of classes and show the relationships between them. Given an element of a class or function hierarchy, C-vision will produce the complete tree emanating in either or both directions. Numerous options for pruning "uninteresting" information are provided.<P>
The C-Vision reformatter provides flexible indentation control, including independent repositioning of curly braces, nested preprocessor statements, case/default statements, and labels. It also provides independently adjustable spacing around each operator.<P>
C-Vision runs under MS-DOS or OS/2. The cost to license C-Vision v4.0 is $239. Updates are available to current C-Vision users for $100. For more information contact Gimpel Software, 3207 Hogarth Lane, Collegeville, PA 19426; +1-610-584-4261; FAX: +1-610-584-4266.<P>
