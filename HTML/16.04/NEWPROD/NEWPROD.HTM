<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Pennington Systems Announces XTRAN for the Year 2000</FONT></H4>

<p>Pennington
Systems Inc. has announced XTRAN, which offers Year 2000 impact analysis and
re-engineering of a wide variety of computer languages, including assemblers,
C/C++, Fortran, COBOL, Pascal, PL/I, PL/M, and a number of proprietary
languages.<p>
XTRAN's rules language, called "meta-code," provides access to details of the
code being processed, including statements, expressions, symbols, and comments.
XTRAN's pattern matching and replacement capabilities, at both the statement
and expression code levels, can automate many code changes required for Year
2000 compliance after analysis has identified the required changes.<p>
Pennington's website shows an example of applying XTRAN to Year 2000 impact
analysis. The example shows the XTRAN rules and results for an iterative
analysis that automates finding references to noncompliant variables using
expression analysis. The procedure includes automatic identification of
variables that are "contaminated" by assignment to or from, or comparison with,
variables known to be noncompliant.<p>

<p>TracePoint
Technology, Inc. has released Visual Coverage for Visual Basic and Visual
Coverage Combo, which combines the new Visual Basic version with the popular
C++ version. Visual Coverage identifies which portions of the code have not

execution. This technique makes it possible to gather more detailed and
accurate information and enables developers to work on executables and DLLs; no
source code or object files are required.<p>

related requirements. For example, changes to a common requirement, such as a
business rule, will visibly flag related requirements in other projects,
allowing users to identify affected requirements.<p>
