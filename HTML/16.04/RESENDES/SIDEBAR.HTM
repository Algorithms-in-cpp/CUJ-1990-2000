<p>I
would be remiss to send you out into the CORBA world without a few cautionary
notes:</p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">CORBA Services</FONT></H4>

<p>There
are very few widely available CORBA Service implementations outside of the
Naming and Event services. Some of these services are under specified, allowing
vendors to create incompatible solutions. Be prepared to do some research
before purchasing a product, lest you get locked into a vendor's proprietary
solution.</p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Firewalls</FONT></H4>

<p>CORBA
communications tend to be very dynamic, making it very difficult to filter
hostile from friendly communications. You will need a CORBA/IIOP-aware firewall
if you want to safely communicate with the outside world.</p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Source Code Portability</FONT></H4>

<p>Currently,
source code developed using one vendor's product is not truly portable to
another vendor's product. The OMG is trying to tackle this issue with its ORB
Portability efforts (ftp://ftp.omg.org/pub/docs/orbos/97-05-15.pdf).</p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Development, Debugging &amp; Metrics</FONT></H4>

<p>There
are few user-friendly tools for CORBA development and debugging. There are even
fewer tools that allow you to monitor and collect statistics on distributed
systems (especially in heterogeneous environments). Finding system bottlenecks
becomes much more difficult in a distributed environment.</p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">DCOM</FONT></H4>

<p>DCOM
is Microsoft's solution for distributed computing and it's hard not to imagine
it becoming a serious CORBA contender. Expect Microsoft to develop the tools
for DCOM that CORBA lacks. o
