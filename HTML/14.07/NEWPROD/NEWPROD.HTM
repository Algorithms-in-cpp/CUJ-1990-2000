               <h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Secant Technologies Announces Persistent Object Manager</FONT></H4>
               
               <p>Secant Technologies has announced the
                    Secant Persistent Object Manager (POM), an object-management
                    toolset for building object-oriented, client/server
                    applications. Its mapping services allow relational, ISAM,
                    and stream-oriented datastores to be integrated into an
                    application's object model. POM supports object-oriented
                    databases, allowing the integration of legacy databases. The
                     metadata compiler compiles an object-oriented schema,
                    including all database mappings, to a working C++ object
                    model. This includes all the code necessary to manage object
                    storage in a database. </p>
               
               <p> In addition to the mapping services,
                    POM provides an integrated Object Manager that offers
                    transaction services to C++ applications. Transaction
                    services allow operations, such as rollback, checkpoint, and
                    commit, to be applied to in-memory objects as well as to
                    databases. These services may reduce the amount of code an
                    application dedicates to error handling, recovery, locking, 
                    and undo operations. In addition, the transaction services
                    are coded to OMG COSS standards, allowing POM clients to
                    plug in to any OMG-compliant, three-tiered environment.
                    </p>
               
               <p> The Secant POM toolset is available
                    for C++ and SOM-enabled languages. It runs on Windows 95,
                    Windows NT, and OS/2. POM supports Visual C++, Borland C++,
                    Visual Age C++, ODBC, and Borland's Database Engine (BDE).

               <h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Sanders-Indev Announces XMan</FONT></H4>
               
               <p>Sanders-Indev has released XMan, an
                    exception manager and tester that creates outlines for
                    testing the exception processes in a multi-file C project.
                    The outlines pinpoint all exception processes, and guide in
                    devising tests without duplication. Each outline contains a
                    description of the exception process, including the name of
                    the error handler called, the source location (file, line, 
                    and host routine) of the call to the error handler, the
                    message that will be shown on the screen when it is
                    executed, and any associated source-file comments. XMan
                    creates a project-wide call tree enhanced by a directory
                    that shows the file and line where each routine is defined,
                    and which call-tree nodes refer to it. XMan also generates "Errors"
                    appendices that can be customized for technical manuals.
                    </p>
               
               <p> XMan runs under DOS versions 3.1 and
                    later, and costs $1,195. </p>

               <p>NobleNet, Inc. has released the EZ-API
                    Component API product family. Using NobleNet's OneDriver
                    architecture, EZ-APIs allow integration of industry-standard
                    and custom APIs and enhance API functions. Component API
                    technology multiplexes API calls over a single network
                    connection between client and server, and presents them to
                    the server as a single-user process. EZ-APIs encapsulate 
                    each API function call in a modifiable source-code wrapper
                    on both the client and server, allowing you to add
                    enhancements to standard APIs such as security, auditing,
                    compression, naming, and caching. </p>
               
               <p> The first member of the EZ-API
                    family, the OneDriver ODBC SDK, relocates the ODBC API from
                    the Windows client to NT or to a variety of UNIX platforms.
                    The SDK includes all necessary communications software to
                    connect Microsoft Windows 3.1, Win95, and NT clients to any
                    standard TCP/IP server platform. </p>
               
               <p> OneDriver ODBC SDK costs $2,500 per
                    server for an unlimited number of users. Supported client
                    platforms include Windows 3.1, Windows 95, and Windows NT.

               <p>Rogue Wave Software has announced an
                    upgrade of Tools.h++, which provides an object-oriented
                    interface to the Standard C++ Library and extends it with

                    of the Standard C++ Library and by those who don't. The
                    product determines whether the Standard C++ Library can run
                    in the developer's environment and, depending on its

               <p>Dynamics Research Corporation has
                    introduced VisualMagic, an object-oriented design and system
                    development environment. VisualMagic is a visual development
                    environment that extends the Rumbaugh object-oriented
                    methodology to create executable OMT models that validate
                    system- and user-interface design and behavior. </p>
               
               <p> The Executable Model allows managers
                    and developers to agree on the required functionality of the
                    design, including the user interfaces. And, because the
                    design they are seeing is the system that will be developed,
                    managers and end users are assured that the developed
                    software will support their requirements. When the design
                    system models accurately reflect the application the user 
                    needs, VisualMagic can automatically generate native C++
                    code from the diagrams that have been drawn. </p>

               <p>Menai Corporation announced that
                    Gamelon, its multiplatform File I/0 Library, now supports
                    Sun Microsystem's Solaris operating system for Sun's SPARC
                    and Intel's x86 architectures. Gamelon was developed to
                    support Internet related software development. Gamelon
                    contains pre-written code modules that simplify and
                    generalize the procedures for creating, writing, and reading
                     data files. </p>
               
               <p> The Gamelon file access library is a
                    multi-language, cross-platform, self-documenting API that
                    allows users to store program data as objects. </p>
               
               <p> Gamelon is priced at $1,195. </p>
