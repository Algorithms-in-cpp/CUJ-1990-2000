               <p>I have always thought Christmas in
                    July was a dumb invention, right up there with fruitcake and
                    vinyl sofas. It's hard to think about Christmas when
                    sidewalks burn your toes, and kids are shooting bottle
                    rockets over your house. And I've got a warning for Santa:
                    you won't last ten minutes here in the Kansas heat, at least
                    not in that funky flight suit. July is a month for good 
                    cheer, though, if you can get some vacation. Ye Merry Senior
                    Ed, who brings new meaning to the word overloaded, is badly
                    in need of a vacation, so I volunteered to write the
                    editor's forum this month. Here's hoping you'll suffer it as
                    gladly as the summer heat. <BR>
                     Just to be ornery, I want to bring you a managing editor's
                    Christmas in July. Specifically, I have a Christmas wish
                    list, complete with items I'd like to find under my elm tree
                    some bright summer morn:</p>
               
               <p><BR>
               <UL><LI>A C++ Standard. This would make a great Christmas present
                    for all of us. Alas, I fear we've been a bit too naughty.
                    We've truly enjoyed this language; we've reveled in it, so
                    much so that I think the C++ committees are afraid to let us
                    have it. In fact, I had a nightmare last night. In the
                    absence of a standard, everyone pretty much did their own
                    thing and developed one, de facto. That left nothing for the
                    committees to do but &#151; shudder &#151; codify existing practice.
                    Okay, okay, I know that was not a nice thing to say. I
                    suppose I won't be getting any ice cream tonight. </LI>
                    <LI>Smart CPUs. We've heard that someday CPU design is going
                    to hit the wall. There really is a limit to how fast those
                    things will go. I find that comforting, because I've never
                    really relished having a high-power microwave device on my
                    desktop. I'd just as soon not be baked alive as I play DOOM.
                    So, Intel, Motorola, DEC, what are you going to do? How
                    about making 'em smarter, not faster? When are we going to
                    see integrated associative memories in our CPUs? Hardware
                    string search engines? Garbage collectors? Instead of
                    pouring billions into atom-width circuit traces, pour them
                    into giving us a standard software interface to universally
                    needed hardware functionality. Yeah, I'm just dreaming, but
                    hey, it's Christmas.</LI>
                    <LI>C Articles. Where have all you C programmer/authors gone?
                    Contrary to popular belief, we have no intention of
                    forsaking our first love, C. It's true we've run precious
                    few C articles in the past few months. How come? Well, not
                    because C is dead. C is still a workhorse language; but for
                    some reason lately we've not encountered many people using
                    it in ways that would make for interesting articles. Notable
                    exceptions are Dwayne Phillips, Marco Savard, Jerry Dwyer,
                    and K.B. Williams. (Incidentally, due to logistical problems
                    we've had to reschedule Dwyer and Williams' "Testing
                    Random Number Generators, Part 2" to August &#151; sorry
                    guys.)</LI>
               </UL></p>
               
               <p>Programmers haven't stopped using C,
                    but I'm guessing that most have stopped using it
                    exclusively. And why not? Unless you have demanding
                    performance or space constraints, as does an embedded
                    systems developer, there's little to keep you from jumping
                    the fence and using some of C++'s nifty features. </p>
               
               <p> I could be wrong, of course, and I'm
                    hoping one of you will prove me wrong, by submitting a
                    killer C article. Even if I'm right, there are still a lot
                    of great C topics begging to be covered: algorithms,
                    embedded systems, multithreading, using C for performance,
                    to name a few. Send a proposal to mbriand@mfi.com.</p>
               
               <p> Well, that's my Christmas in July
                    wish list. I hope Santa brings you what you want, and have a
                    happy fiscal new year. <BR>
