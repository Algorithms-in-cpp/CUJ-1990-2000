<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0034_001A">Pure Software Ships Purify 3 and PureCoverage 1.0<A name="0034_001A"></FONT></h4></P>
Pure Software Inc. has begun shipping Purify 3.0 and PureCoverage 1.0. Purify 3.0 is a software quality development tool that detects run-time errors and memory leaks in C/C++ applications. Purify incorporates Pure Software OCI technology. OCI examines the object code and inserts checking instructions around the memory functions to monitor usage at run time and report illegal memory accesses and leaks. OCI lets Purify analyze applications including shared and third-party libraries.<P>
Features of Purify 3.0 include a GUI that provides message browsing while an application is running and an outline view which displays error messages and simplifies navigation. Also included in Purify 3.0 is single-click access to source code, which lets developers make changes at the point where an error occurred.<P>
Purify 3.0 is integrated with PureCoverage 1.0, Pure Software's code coverage analysis product. PureCoverage 1.0 lets users manage, manipulate, and analyze data into a variety of formats and reports. Data can be viewed through Purify 3.0's outline browser and then manipulated according to user specifications. Inserted at the object level, PureCoverage integrates into the development environment. PureCoverage supports C/C++ and FORTRAN, and runs on multiple platforms including Sun, Solaris, and HP.<P>
Purify 3.0 is priced at $1,298. PureCoverage 1.0 is priced at $898. For more information contact <I>Pure Software Inc., 1309 S. Mary Ave., Sunnyvale, CA 94087, (408) 720-1600; FAX: (408) 720-9200; E-mail: info@pure.com.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0034_001B">ARSoftware Releases ARC++ 2.0<A name="0034_001B"></FONT></h4></P>
ARSoftware has released ARC++ v2.0, a C/C++ development tool. According to the company, with a few adjustments to the existing <I>make</I> or project files, ARC++ automatically determines whether a header file change affects previously compiled modules and alters the <I>make</I> process accordingly, giving the user control over recompiles.<P>
Features of ARC++ v2.0 include exportable classes that eliminate the need for header files and intelligent macros that provide encapsulated code generation. ARC++'s macro capability automatically analyzes class definitions, which can loop, branch, and access the parse tree/symbol table to generate code based on previous declarations. Defined within C++'s block structure, these macros are capable of being inherited. Callback macros in multiple base classes ensure that derived calls have the appropriate support code generated. Other features of ARC++ include: overloaded enumerators, bound function pointers, prototyped Vararg functions, automatic functions, arrays with bounds, modify detection, user-defined operations, combination operators, user-defined modifiers, and hidden arguments.<P>
ARC++ v2.0 for DOS and Macintosh is priced at $249, and $299 for UNIX. Upgrade pricing for existing users is $29 for DOS and Macintosh, and $39 for UNIX. For more information contact <I>ARSoftware, 8201 Corporate Dr., Suite 1110, Landover, MD 20785, (800) 257-0073 or (301) 459-3773; On-line catalog: URL:http://arsoftware.arclch.com.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0034_001C">Cygnus Announces GUI for GNU Debugger<A name="0034_001C"></FONT></h4></P>
Cygnus Support has announced plans to release a GUI for their GNU Debugger, GDB. The GUI for GDB provides programmers with a consistent interface for native UNIX development, as well as cross-platform development hosted on UNIX X11 and MS-Windows 3.1 platforms. The Cygnus GUI allows users to extend or modify the GUI based on their user-interface preferences.<P>
According to Cygnus, the design of the GDB interfaces emphasizes the information display and the direct manipulation of displayed objects. Additional features of the GUI include windows for source, object code, data display, stack frames, breakpoint/watchpoint lists, and a target state window. The GUI also includes context-sensitive, on-line help and keyboard shortcuts for common operations such as single-stepping. Both high-level and low-level graphics capabilities will also be available in the GUI. All features are available to both native and cross-debugging configurations of GDB. The GUI will be available on all host/target platforms currently supported by Cygnus. Source code is also available.<P>
The company plans to release the UNIX version of the GUI for GDB January 1, 1995, and the Windows version April 2, 1995. For more information contact <I>Cygnus Support, 1937 Landings Dr., Mountain View, CA 94043, (415) 903-1400; FAX: (415) 903-0122.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0034_001D">Apogee Announces Apogee-C/C++ and Apogee-FORTRAN 77/90 Compilers<A name="0034_001D"></FONT></h4></P>
Apogee Software has announced Apogee-C/C++ and Apogee-FORTRAN 77/90 compilers for SPARC. Apogee-C/C++ and Apogee-FORTRAN 77/90 compile programs written in C/C++ and FORTRAN 77 or FORTRAN 90 into machine code optimized for RISC-based computers.<P>
Apogee-C/C++ is an optimizing compiler accepting C/C++. The C dialects accepted include the ISO/ANSI C standard and Kernighan &amp; Richie C. The C++ dialects accepted include the current draft of the ANSI C++ standard (including templates and exceptions), Cfront 2.1 C++, and AT&amp;T 3.0 C++. To assist in converting older C or C++ programs to ANSI C or C++, the compiler also optionally accepts non-standard uses of C/C++ and provides warning messages.<P>
Apogee-FORTRAN 77/90 is an optimizing compiler accepting two dialects of FORTRAN: the 1977 and 1990 ISO/ANSI standard. In addition, the compiler accepts extensions found in Sun, IBM, VAX/VMS, Cray, and MIL-STD 1753 FORTRAN 77s. The FORTRAN 90 mode is compliant with the ISO/ANSI FORTRAN 90 standard.<P>
The Apogee-C/C++ and Apogee-FORTRAN 77/90 compilers work with several programming tools that are offered as optional items on the same CD-ROM: the TotalView graphical interface debugger from BBN, the SNiFF++ visual programming environment from takeFive Software (C/C++ only), and the Sentinel error detection programming tool from AIB Software. In addition, there is a free GDB debugger on the CD-ROM modified by Apogee to work with C/C++ as well as with FORTRAN.<P>
Apogee compilers have been specifically tuned to take advantage of the hardware features for each implementation of the SPARC architecture including: SuperSPARC, hyperSPARC, MicroSPARCI, MicroSPARC II, and PowerUp. Apogee compilers also let the user select the specific target processor by a compiler switch. For more information contact <I>Apogee Software Inc., 1901 S.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0034_0020">ViewSoft Releases UTAH 1.1<A name="0034_0020"></FONT></h4></P>
ViewSoft, Inc. has released UTAH 1.1, a C/C++ application and GUI builder. UTAH 1.1 lets programmers create GUIs without adding interface dependencies to their program objects or writing interface code. Included in UTAH 1.1 are several GUI building technologies that automate the assembly, testing, and maintenance of GUIs: the Editable Object System (EOS), Semantic Interface Technology, and a User Extensible Toolkit.<P>
The Editable Object System (EOS), which is a C++ class library with platform-independent extensions, provides reflection (self-describing objects) and run-time-binding. User objects inherit this extended functionality from base EOS objects. The Semantic Interface Technology uses "smart components" that eliminate interface dependencies for the program objects. UTAH automatically performs type conversion and synchronization of interface objects with program data whenever either interface or program variables change. This automatic synchronization frees users from routine user-interface event management, while preserving event access for performance or custom control. UTAH's User Extensible Toolkit lets users create interactions which are then used, like the components supplied with UTAH, to build complex interactions without learning the interactor' s API or sub-classing to get control. Existing VBX controls can be imported into UTAH and used as if they were native UTAH components.<P>
UTAH 1.1 for Windows is priced at $1,490. For more information contact <I>ViewSoft Inc., Provo, UT, (801) 377-0787.</I><P>
