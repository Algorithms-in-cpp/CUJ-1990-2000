               <p>Kuck &amp; Associates, Inc. (KAI) has
                    released the KAI C++ v3.0 compiler. This release of KAI C++
                    includes draft-standard C++ class libraries, support for
                    member templates, and usability features for large codes.
                    KAI C++ v3.0 features include near draft-standard C++ class
                    libraries, not just STL and iostreams; support for member
                    templates; optimization of template expressions; and 
                    building of libraries that contain template instantiations.
                    </p>
               
               <p> Customers can immediately update any
                    earlier versions to KAI C++ v3.0. There is no charge for
                    customers who have an existing support service agreement or
                    for customers who purchased Version 2 after April 1, 1996.
                    Also, KAI C++ is now available with a floating license on
                    the SPARC Solaris and IBM AIX systems. </p>

               <BR> Accelerated Technology Announces Nucleus C++ RTOS</FONT></H4>
               
               <p>Accelerated Technology has announced
                    Nucleus C++, a real-time operating system (RTOS) that
                    provides direct support for multitasking and object-oriented
                    methodologies. Nucleus C++ provides active objects and other
                    object-oriented mechanisms to synchronize and otherwise
                    manage the existence and behavior of active objects within a
                    real-time software system. Direct support for multitasking 
                    is achieved by encapsulating execution into objects.
                    Standard C++ mechanisms are used for creating, using, and
                    ultimately destroying objects. The executable portions of
                    the active objects are created and managed automatically.
                    </p>
               
               <p> Nucleus C++ addresses common
                    performance and management concerns about migrating to an
                    object-oriented design methodology. The underlying RTOS is
                    the Nucleus PLUS real-time operating system. Nucleus PLUS is
                    a small, fast, and portable C multitasking kernel. Common
                    concerns regarding code size and execution speed are
                    addressed by tight coupling to the RTOS. Nucleus C++
                    requires Nucleus PLUS. </p>
               
               <p> Nucleus C++ costs $2,500. Nucleus
                    PLUS costs from $5,000 to $9,000 depending on the platform.

                    MFC-based plug-in's view, toolbars, and status bars;
                    COPIDocTemplate, a special CsingleDoc Template derivative
                    that automatically creates a document and view when the
                    plug-in is provided with a file stream. </p>
               
               <p> The introductory price for Objective

               <p>Azalea Software, Inc. has begun
                    shipping carrick v1.1, an encryption utility that provides
                    private key encryption. Unlike most other computer security
                    products, carrick is based on the new Blowfish encryption
                    algorithm. While others debate the merits of 40- or 56-bit
                    key lengths, carrick allows keys up to 448 bits long.
                    Because of the strength of the underlying algorithm, the 
                    U.S. government won't allow carrick to be sold outside the
                    U.S. </p>
               
               <p> The Windows version runs under

                    Windows product include drag-and-drop support from the File
                    Manager, the option to save the two halves of a key to disk,
                    notification of potentially weak keys, and a helpful
                    rotating tip of the day highlighting sound security

                     bus master and slave DMA; and programmed I/O. </p>
               
               <p> The WinDK Kit follows the guidelines
                    of the MS NT DDK and MS Developers Network to improve
                    portability of drivers. Device drivers created with the
                    WinDK Kit use features of NT that have been difficult to
                    access, such as performance counters and debugger
                    extensions. </p>
               
               <p> The WinDK Kit includes sample device
                    drivers and the WinDK class libraries. The WinDK Device
                    Driver Development Kit for NT 4.0 costs $795, which includes
                    six months of free support and 90 days of free upgrades. An
                    introductory price of $595 is available for the WinDK Intel
                    version. </p>

               <p>Continuus Software Corporation has
                    begun shipping Continuus Change Management Suite v4.2.
                    Continuus/CM v4.2 tracks changes through the entire set of
                    files involved in a given programming task. </p>
               
               <p> Continuus' task-based CM capability
                    assumes the burden of tracking and operating on related sets
                    of changes, which means the following: it eliminates the
                    need for developers to maintain lists of files they've
                    edited to complete each enhancement and bug fix; it frees
                    the developer from checking in files one at a time and
                    eliminates the failed compilations common in file-based CM 
                    systems when programmers forget to check in all of the files
                    edited to complete a task; it allows changes related to an
                    enhancement or bug fix to be backed out of a software
                    release with a mouse click, useful when incomplete tasks are
                    holding up software delivery; and it enhances software
                    quality through detection of incomplete or inconsistent sets
                    of changed files. </p>
               
               <p> The price of the server license for

               <p>NewCode Technology has ported NCi to
                    Windows NT. NCi, a standards-compliant C++ interpreter for
                    embedding in end-user applications, provides end-users of
                    Windows NT applications the ability to extend functionality
                    in their C++ products without opening up large portions of
                    the development environment. </p>
               
               <p> NCi allows interpreted code to call
                    compiled code with full type checking. It also allows new
                    variables, functions, and types (including subclasses) to be
                    created at run time. In addition, it ensures proper
                    interaction between all interpreted code and compiled code.
                    </p>
               
               <p> NCi is available for Windows NT and
                    Windows 95 working with Visual C++, for SunOS and Solaris
                    working with SparcWorks C++, and for HP-UX working with the
                    HP C++ compiler. </p>
               
               <p> NCi is priced separately for
                    development and deployment; prices are per developer. Single
                    licenses start at $5,000 and fall to $2,500 each in
                    quantity. For preliminary evaluation, download the
                    interpreter free of charge via FTP (see web site below).

                    actual application, which runs on a server computer. The net

                    the user's machine, while it is really on a server. Open 
                    Dialog recognizes code written in any language capable of
