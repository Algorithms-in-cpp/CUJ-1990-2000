               <p> Good news from the standards front.
                    Committees WG21 and X3J11 voted out the draft C++ Standard
                    for a second round of balloting as a Committee Draft. See
                    Dan Saks's column for more details. For my part, I was happy
                    to see the committees exercise a modicum of restraint right
                    before this important milestone. It took me only a week to
                    update my library in response to the changes voted in at the
                    Kona meeting. After a typical meeting, I usually have to
                    invest twice as much energy after a meeting to do the same
                    task. </p>
               
               <p> In principle, I should have had even
                    less work to do. At the previous meeting, in Stockholm last
                    July, the committees promised themselves to stop making any
                    substantive changes to the draft. Kona was to be just an
                    editorial cleanup and a last chance to fix anything
                    demonstrably broken. The effect of this pronunciamento was
                    not quite as absolute as many of us would have liked. It
                    simply encouraged some enthusiastic advocates of last-minute
                    change to broaden their definition of "broken" to cover
                    any undesirable aspect of status quo. Nevertheless, the real
                    desire to stabilize C++ did manage to damp out much
                    enthusiasm for change. </p>
               
               <p> Standard C++ is now well defined and
                    stable for years to come. Well, mostly. The draft will
                    certainly be stable at least until July 1997, because that's
                    the next meeting at which changes can be voted in. And those
                    changes should be only to fix things deemed "broken" by an
                    ISO national body. But I must observe that the committees
                    still have a few open action items &#151; aspects of the C++
                    language or library that some members still feel need
                    refining. Some change is inevitable. </p>
               
               <p> I must also echo Dan's observations
                    that the draft C++ Standard is still not a model of clarity.
                    It describes a very ambitious language that has evolved
                    considerably in seven years of standardization. Few people,
                    if any, will assert that this document is anywhere near as
                    precise as the C Standard, which describes a far less
                    complex language. As a consequence, we can expect a steady
                    stream of Defect Reports, to clarify the meaning of parts of
                    the C++ Standard, beginning as soon as the draft is approved
                    as an ANSI/ISO Standard. </p>
               
               <p> But what the heck. At least we now
                    know, pretty much, what C++ should look like for the near
                    future. Vendors are rushing to flesh out the last missing
                    features in their implementations. You can expect fairly
                    complete compilers and libraries to appear at a steady rate
                    throughout 1997. That's something to look forward to.</p>
