<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Applied Microsystems Introduces LiveCODE, CodeTEST-Native, and CodeTEST- SW-In-Ckt</FONT></H4>
<p>Applied Microsystems (AMC) has introduced LiveCODE, an interactive run-time tracing system that traces and analyzes the execution history of an application as it is running in the target system. Using LiveCODE, embedded software developers can trace the activity of a program with no preparation of application source, object, or the executable files.</p>
<p>AMC has also released two new versions of CodeTEST &#151; CodeTEST-Native and CodeTEST-SW-In-Ckt &#151; suites of test and analysis tools based on instrumentation technology that can be used through the entire embedded software development cycle. CodeTEST-Native can be used during the workstation-based development stages. CodeTEST-SW-In-Ckt can be used once a software target becomes available to conduct early runtime analysis.</p>
<p>LiveCODE for PowerPC prices start at $4,000 per unit. Packages of five and ten units are also available. CodeTEST-Native for Sun/Solaris costs $2,500 for the Trace, Memory, or Statement Coverage modules; $7,000 for the Decision Coverage module; and $20,000 for the Modified Decision Coverage Module. CodeTEST-SW-In-Ckt for Windows and Unix costs $4,000 for the Trace, Memory, or Statement Coverage modules; $7,000 for the Decision Coverage module, and $20,000 for the Modified Condition Coverage module.</p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">GrammaTech Releases CodeSurfer 1.0</FONT></H4>
<p>GrammaTech announced the release of CodeSurfer 1.0, a software static analysis tool. CodeSurfer provides interprocedural program slicing for software development, inspection, and maintenance. Program slicing is a technique made possible with system dependence graphs that reveals the semantic threads within source code. A forward slice from any point of interest shows all the code that is impacted by that point of interest. A backward slice shows all the code that impacts the point of interest. Slices can be computed all at once or they can be navigated incrementally.</p>
<p>CodeSurfer is designed for analyzing ANSI C programs of under 100,000 lines of code. It supports Windows and Solaris 2.5 and later. A free evaluation copy is available from the company's website.</p>
<p>All CodeSurfer licenses are network floating licenses. To run CodeSurfer, you need a "Builder" license and a "Viewer" license. The CodeSurfer Entry Package costs $4,000, which includes one Builder and three Viewers. Additional Viewers and Builders are available; you can generate a quotation good for 30 days from their website.</p>
<p>For more information, contact GrammaTech, Inc., +1.607.273.7340; fax +1.607.273.8752; info@grammatech.com; www.codesurfer.com or www.grammatech.com.</p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">MindView Releases <I>Thinking in C</I> CD-ROM</FONT></H4>
<p>MindView, Inc. has released the CD-ROM, <I>Thinking in C: Foundations for Java and C++ Programming,</I> a short course that prepares software developers to tackle today's most in-demand object-oriented languages. The course includes lectures, slides, exercises, and solutions, which teach new programmers the foundations of C in preparation for learning Java and C++. The lectures are given by Chuck Allison, who is both a columnist and consulting editor for <I>CUJ,</I> and a highly respected teacher of C, C++, and Java languages.</p>
<p>According to MindView, "In the rush to master the object-oriented paradigm, it is altogether too easy to pass over fundamental language features that are key in using these languages effectively. Through clear exposition and to-the-point illustrations, this course effectively bridges the gap." Topics include: lexical elements, control structures, functions, data structures, I/O, pointers, and the preprocessor.</p>
<p>The CD contains the entire <I>Thinking in C</I> training seminar, which includes more than seven hours of audio synchronized with 298 slides of information. The <I>Thinking in C</I> CD-ROM is in RealMedia format and uses audio extensively. It works with Windows 95/NT, Windows 3.1, Power Macintosh, Linux, and any other platform that supports the RealPlayer. RealPlayers for Windows and Macinthosh are shipped with the CD-ROM, but newer and/or alternate versions can be downloaded directly from RealNetworks.</p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Walnut Creek hosts CUG CD-ROM on FTP.CDROM.COM</FONT></H4>
<p>The CUG (C/C++ Users Group) CD-ROM represents the culmination of the work of hundreds of developers over the past 18 years. Each has made their own unique contribution of a C or C++ library, tool, or application. The entire CUG CD-ROM is now available online for the first time at ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/cug. The CUG CD-ROM is also contained in the book <I>C/C++ Treasure Chest</I> (R&amp;D Books; ISBN: 0879305142) Of course the CD can also be purchased directly on the Walnut Creek website (www.cdrom.com/titles/prog/cug.phtml).</p>
<p>The mission of the CUG is to both publicize and distribute user-supported software. User-supported software is a term coined by Robert Ward, the first steward of the CUG. User-supported means that people using the software are not passive but actively collaborating to improve and update the software. This can happen only when the source code is made freely available. The CUG promotes user-supported software through low-cost distribution and publicizes it with help from <I>C/C++ Users Journal</I>. Walnut Creek has been an important partner throughout it all, helping produce the CUG CD-ROM as one of the first-ever CD-ROM titles for programmers. </p>
<p>The CUG has come to rely on the Internet for nearly all of its activities: finding new sources, publishing indexes, and personal contacts with members. The CUG website (www.HAL9K.com/cug) is a volunteer operation that provides electronic indexes to all volumes by Author, Subject, Language, Platform, and Volume #. The CUG now searches the Internet regularly to bring the best and most portable code from around the world to you. If you've got something to share, CUG would like to hear from you too. Contact Victor Volkman: sysop@hal9k.com. </p>
