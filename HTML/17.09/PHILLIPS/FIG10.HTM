<pre>
Put the start node on list OPEN (unexpanded nodes).

Set cost of the start node to 0.

IF start node is a goal node, show solution.

while searching for a solution

   IF list OPEN is empty, no solution exists, quit.

   Remove node n from list OPEN that has the lowest cost
   and place it on list CLOSED (expanded nodes).

   IF node n is a goal node, show solution.

   Expand node n.

   Calculate the cost of each successor of n.

   Place all successors of node n at end of list OPEN.
