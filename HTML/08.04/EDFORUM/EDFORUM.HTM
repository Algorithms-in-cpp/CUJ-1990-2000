<A name="00EA_0000"><A name="00EA_0000">In this issue we again present &#151; as part of our continuing public service program &#151; the winners of the International Obfuscated C Code contest (see Don Libes' Column). As always, the winning entries are perversely clever and entertaining &#151; and frightfully effective demonstrations that "clever and entertaining" don't build understandability.<P>
Least there be any misunderstanding, we do not encourage these obscure programming practices. We publicize the results only as a public service &#151; to give this dangerous form of expression a safe outlet. "Please, please, boys and girls, don't attempt this trick at home. Remember these are highly trained professionals." (We hope.)<P>
I suspect an eastern mystic would take satisfaction from the pre-processor's critical role in many of the winning entries. When used simply and directly, the pre-processor contributes as much to understandability and maintainability as any language component. But when purposely exploited &#151; when the pre-processor's latent powers are stretched to achieve non-obvious ends &#151; understandability and maintainability are seriously damaged.<P>
"Too much of a good thing" and all that.<P>
We'll continue our public service campaign in the next issue by announcing the winners of our Bad C Pun Contest. Like the obfuscated code contest, the bad pun contest is intended as a "safety valve". Through this contest we were able to capture and destroy several hundred distressingly bad C puns, hopefully removing them from circulation, at least for a while.<P>
An independent judge selected the most nearly humorous groaners for prizes. We saved only the winners, and will share those with you in the next issue. But, please don't expect much &#151; remember this was a "bad" pun contest, and bad they were.<P>
Sincerely yours,<P>
