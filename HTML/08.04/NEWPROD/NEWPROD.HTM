<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00EC_0086">C++ Class Library Supports Matrices<A name="00EC_0086"></FONT></h4></P>
The M++ Matrix Class Library from Ansys Software Co., Inc., allows C++ users to declare dynamic matrices or arrays. M++ matrix objects support the direct manipulation of arrays, matrices or other groups of data, much as do symbolic matrix languages like Matlab, GAUSS or APL, but retain all the portability and speed advantages of C++.<P>
M++ implements generalized submatrices, allowing a programmer to write and manipulate general subsets of a given matrix or array, a feature particularly useful to those developing systems utilizing time-series data. Submatrices allow the programmer to view and manipulate data in alternate ways without physically reordering, restoring or rereading the data from disk.<P>
The class library handles and isolates memory allocation and provides compile-time selectable bounds checking, aiding in the debugging of complex programs.<P>
The M++ library provides int, float, double, complex, submatrix, index and decomposition matrix classes which can be extended, modified or limited via inheritance. Also, full C++ source code is available to support direct customization.<P>
The M++ Matrix Class Library is available for MS-DOS, OS/2 and UNIX C++ compilers conforming to C++ versions 1.2 or 2.0. Prices start at $195. Contact Ansys Software Co., Inc., 16950 151st Ave. SE, Renton, WA 98058 (800) 366-1573 or (206) 228-3170.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00EC_0092">Planned Lattice Compiler Packages Will Include Dos Extender<A name="00EC_0092"></FONT></h4></P>
Lattice, Inc., plans to release its new 80286 and 80386 C Development Systems for MS-DOS and OS/2 on March 1 and April 1 respectively.<P>
According to Dave Schmitt, Lattice president, "These new C compiler packages will feature a complete programming environment, including a DOS extender, compiler, assembler, debugger, editor, global optimizer, programming utilities, and nearly 800 library functions."<P>
The Lattice 80286 C Development System runs under MS-DOS, Extended DOS, or OS/2 to create a single executable program which can run under MS-DOS, Extended DOS, or OS/2. The package includes a royalty-free DOS Extender which developers may include with their software at no charge. Lattice's DOS Extender allows users to run programs of up to nearly 16 megabytes. An included configuration optimizer performance tunes the DOS Extender.<P>
Lattice's 80386 C Development System takes advantage of the 80386 and 80486's 32-bit processing both for the compiler and generated programs. The system runs under Lattice's 80386 Extended DOS, PharLap's Extended DOS, or OS/2 v2 and generates programs which run under Extended DOS or OS/2 v2. The compiler is upwardly compatible so it will accept source code written for MS-DOS or OS/2 v1.<P>
These new compilers introduce Lattice's "Extended Family Mode." In this mode, Schmitt explains, "a single program can run under either Extended DOS or OS/2. Software developers only need to maintain one program even though their customers use the program under several different operating systems."<P>
The 80286 C Development System is priced at $495; the 80386 version at $900. Contact Lattice, Inc., 2500 South Highland Ave., Lombard, IL 60148 (708) 916-1600; FAX (708) 916-1190.<P>
