<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01E9_010D">Development Environment Designed To Support DSP Programming<A name="01E9_010D"></FONT></h4></P>
BittWare has announced the release of an introductory version of DspHq, an open architecture DSP software design environment.<P>
DspHq is an operating environment for the PC, designed to develop or study DSP algorithms. DspHq's open architecture allows users to integrate included functions, popular function libraries, and their own routines written in C or Pascal. Algorithms pass and share common data structures and can be calculated by the PC or downloaded to a signal processor. DspHq includes a menu interface, command interpreter, batch command processor, file and memory management, and screen graphics with hardcopy support for most printers.<P>
The batch command language allows users to create and simulate an entire DSP system, with user input, breakpoints and single-stepping. Source code examples are provided for "MathPak87" and Numerical Recipes in "C" analysis routines. Interfaces are available for most signal processing boards based on the AT&amp;T DSP32/DSP32C devices.<P>
The introductory version is available for $250. Full release, with added interfaces, is expected third quarter 1990 at a price of $495.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01E9_0112">ObjectVision Generates Object Code In C++ Or Pascal<A name="01E9_0112"></FONT></h4></P>
ObjectVision Inc. has begun shipping ObjectVision v1.0, a software tool that lets users develop object-oriented programs visually. Using ObjectVision a developer can "draw" a program's objects, interface, and database connections and either run the application in ObjectVision or automatically convert the application into commented, ready-to-compile code in either C++ or Turbo Pascal 5.5.<P>
In v1.0 the developer can create new objects with a mouse and add attributes and procedures to them graphically. Relationships between objects can be established by drawing a line between the two objects. Buttons and switches can be created in ObjectVision's bitmap editor. Version 1.0 also offers ways to visualize and edit object hierarchies, including a "3-D view."<P>
ObjectVision will convert applications into various OOP languages so developers can start learning to develop programs without having to commit to a specific language for application delivery.<P>
ObjectVision generates code for all versions of Zortech C++, Glockenspiel C++, and Turbo Pascal. The package is priced at $399 and runs on PC compatibles with 640K of RAM, an enhanced EGA or VGA monitor, and a mouse. An academic version, priced at $99, supports all features but does not generate code. A demo disk is priced at $30.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01E9_0119">Microsoft Releases Windows Version 3.0<A name="01E9_0119"></FONT></h4></P>
Mircrosoft Corporation has announced the release of Microsoft Windows v3.0, an operating system designed for one megabyte personal computers. Windows v3.0 uses an interface similar to Microsoft OS/2 Presentation Manager.<P>
The user shell is made up of: The Program Manager, which presents Windows applications and system functions as colorful icons that users can rearrange in groups most intuitive to them; The File Manager, which allows users to manipulate, locate, drop, and drag files to and from any disk drive; and, the Control Panel, which exploits more advanced color hardware and lets users design their own "look."<P>
Windows v3.0's new shell integrates into its menus the ability to easily and consistently connect and disconnect to network servers.<P>
The new v3.0 memory management system allows users to keep multiple large applications open and accessible. Now Windows applications can exploit up to 16MB of memory. On systems with 386 processors, Windows can exploit the virtual protected-mode capabilities and provide up to 48 MB of memory.<P>
Windows v3.0 provides standardized interface software to all network-specific device drivers for a wide range of networks. Network administrators can establish a single shared Windows directory on a file server instead of having to maintain a separate copy of Windows for each user configuration. In addition to Program Manager, File Manager, and Control Panel, LAN users have access to network printer information through Print Manager.<P>
A related announcement by Microsoft revealed that they will release the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows v3.0 in early summer. An improved graphical user interface and the ability to directly address up to 16 MB of RAM on machines with an 80286 processor, plus virtual memory on 80386-based systems are key features of SDK.<P>
Microsoft has also announced another early summer release, the Microsoft Windows to OS/2 Software Migration Kit to port Windows applications to Microsoft OS/2 Presentation Manager. The new kit provides a layer of code that allows converted Windows applications to emulate OS/2 applications and allows applications to use advanced OS/2 features.<P>
For more information or prices on any of these products contact Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399. (206) 882-8080; FAX (206) 883-8101.<P>
