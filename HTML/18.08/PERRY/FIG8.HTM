<h4><A NAME="heading1">Figure 8: Relationship of current through a resistor to resistance when the voltage difference is fixed. On the left, the voltage difference is positive: current flows forward. On the right, the voltage difference is negative: current flows backward. Shaded regions represent impossible conditions in which resistance is negative.</A></h4>
