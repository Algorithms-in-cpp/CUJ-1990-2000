<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Altrasoft Unveils OO-Browser</FONT></H4>

<p>Altrasoft has released its OO-Browser, a multi-language, object-oriented code browser. The OO-Browser supports C, C++, Lisp and its object system (CLOS), Eiffel, Java, Objective-C, Python, and Smalltalk code. </p>

<p>The OO-Browser reads source code exclusively, eliminating the need to compile or have a full system before browsing. Most operations that can be applied to a single class or method can also be applied to a whole set at once.</p>

<p>The OO-Browser runs within GNU Emacs or XEmacs editors, or as a part of Altrasoft's integrated development environment, InfoDock. It can also call out to other editors, such as vi. Browser features can be used directly in the editor without display of the browser user interface (e.g., symbol names can be completed, and definition of symbols can be found at the touch of a key).</p>

<p>Prices for OO-Browser packages start at $599. Complete source code is included with a purchase for local adaptation or extension.</p>

<p>For more information, contact Altrasoft, Inc., 888.258.7638 or +1.408.243.3324; info@altrasoft.com or sales@altrasoft.com; www.altrasoft.com.</p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">General Software Offers Embedded BIOS 4.1</FONT></H4>

<p>General Software has upgraded its Embedded BIOS product. Embedded BIOS 4.1 initializes an industrial PC or embedded target as it would for DOS, Windows 95, or Windows NT, and then boots Windows CE from ROM, Flash, or disk. The new capability, called "CE Ready," enables industrial PCs and targets that employ Embedded BIOS in their design to boot the entire range of industry-standard operating systems, including Microsoft's newest operating system, Windows CE.</p>

<p>Embedded BIOS 4.1 has a built-in debugger that can be used to check out address and data paths, memory, and Flash components. The debugger can be used to answer "what-if" questions about custom chipset initialization interactively, without additional ROM programming cycles. Manufacturing Mode allows the system's disk drives and Flash disks to be managed remotely, and permits the BIOS or Windows CE to be re-Flashed in the system over a standard RS232 connection to a host PC.</p>

<p>Embedded BIOS comes with a royalty-free copy of Embedded DOS-ROM, the company's run-from-ROM DOS for embedded systems, and a royalty-free copy of its Resident Flash Disk software that emulates floppy or hard disks with solid-state Flash media.</p>
