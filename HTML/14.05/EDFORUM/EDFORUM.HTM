               <p> I've been both amused and bemused by
                    all the recent uproar over Java. Mind you, it looks like a
                    perfectly fine little language. As the newest member of the
                    C/C++ family, it offers an interesting new mix of design
                    features. We will be providing more editorial coverage on
                    the blend of features in Java as the user community for it
                    matures. But a revolution in computing it ain't. </p>
               
               <p> Had the same language appeared ten,
                    or even five, years ago, it would have made a much smaller
                    initial splash. Maybe Computer Language or Byte would have
                    seen fit to run an article or two. Maybe a small user group
                    would grow up around it. But adoptions of the language by
                    various companies would not have made the front page of The
                    Wall Street Journal and/or USA Today, and certainly not
                    three times in a given week.  </p>
               
               <p> The current phenomemon, as you
                    probably know, is venture capital. More precisely, it's way
                    too much venture capital pursuing way too few legitimate
                    investment opportunities. Anything coming along that smacks
                    of real utility attracts hype and hope all out of proportion
                    to the freight it can properly carry. As always, the
                    "savvy" investors want the absolute latest cutting-edge
                    technology &#151; so long as it's also tried and true and safe.
                    So they follow each others like lemmings from one fad to
                    another. </p>
               
               <p> The distortion of market values did
                    not begin with Java, of course. Microsoft is a fine company
                    with considerable depth, to be sure. But it has nowhere near
                    the depth and diversity of IBM, and yet the total stock
                    values of the two companies are comparable. Even more
                    extreme is the recent spate of Internet startups that have
                    achieved astronomical stock prices with little or no history
                    to sustain such valuations. They are the impetus behind the
                    Java frenzy. </p>
               
               <p> Don't get me wrong. I'm always happy
                    to see my fellow techies get good rewards for their
                    ingenuity. The chance to beome a millionaire on brains alone
                    is one of the few things that keeps us all going, besides
                    rancid vending-machine coffee at 3 a.m. My concern is for
                    when the bubble bursts, or the bloom simply fades from the
                    rose. Going from riches to rags makes for a particularly
                    tough mid-life crisis, at any age. It's not a fate that I'd
                    wish on anybody. </p>
               
               <p> So let's hear it for the little
                    language that probably can. I'm sure Java will find uses
                    outside the narrow confines of Web browsers. I'm equally
                    sure that it will help change the way we think about
                    programming, as have C and C++ before it. But let's not
                    imbue it with any more magical properties than it actually
                    has &#151; as another stimulating brew to help programmers make
                    it through the night.</p>
