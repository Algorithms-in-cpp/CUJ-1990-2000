               <P>Rogue Wave Software has released DBFactory, a graphical
                    code-generator for building C++ classes that represent
                    business objects, such as customer information tables, based
                    on information from a database. DBFactory also generates the
                    associated documentation for each class automatically.</P>
               
               <P> With DBFactory, you create DBTools.h++ classes by using a
                    point-and-click interface to select the database elements to
                    be represented in the generated code. Selections can be
                    modified with on-the-fly queries or user-defined
                    information. DBFactory then generates C++ header files, C++
                    source code files, and documentation files. Since the
                    generated code is DBTools.h++ code, it is portable across
                    Windows and UNIX operating systems, and provides a common
                    API to leading relational databases. </P>
               
               <P>DBFactory is priced at $995 for a single-user license. Site
                    licenses may also be purchased. DBFactory supports the
                    Windows NT operating system. </P>

               <P>Aladdin Software Engineering Ltd. (ALSE) announces the
                    release of HOPE (The Human Oriented Programming
                    Environment). HOPE looks at software code as a collection of
                    particles (a particle is defined as each unique function,
                    class, method, etc., of the code) that are stored as unique
                    objects in the HOPE database or repository. This differs
                    from existing Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and
                    Software Configuration Management (SCM) systems, which are
                    based on plain text files. </P>
               
               <P> HOPE's collaborative features include information sharing
                    between team members, locking of fine-grained objects,
                    process-oriented SCM smart merge tools, full control of the
                    development project, and real-time change management. </P>
               
               <P> HOPE runs under Windows 3.x, Windows NT, and Windows 95. A
                    full version of HOPE costs $995 per seat. A special
                    introductory offer, available until July 31, 1996, includes
                    a three-user license for only $295, plus a free upgrade to
                    the next version of HOPE. </P>

                    WinLink 386 creates a completely visual linker/locator for
                    embedded development. WinLink 386 combines object and
                    library modules to produce 32-bit protected-mode programs
                    for 386, 486, and Pentium embedded applications; 16-bit
                    protected mode programs; Intel OMF files;  and PROMable hex
                    and binary files. With the new version, Link&amp;Locate has
                    now added compatibility with Borland C/C++ v4.5 as well as
                    the WATCOM and Borland Assemblers. </P>
               
               <P> Also, SSI has announced the release for Beta testing of
                    SoftProbe for Windows Remote Debugger. The beta version of

               <P>Centauri Software has announced VisualCoder++, a
                    C/C++-specific code processor for Windows 3.1, Windows 95,
                    Windows NT 3.5, and OS/2 Warp. VisualCoder++ lets you build
                    code by dragging and dropping onto a control flow line, or
                    by using key equivalents. It automatically formats and
                    indents statements. Color-coded comments can be attached to
                    any statement. VisualCoder++ features the ability to convert
                    a block of statements into a function and declare variables,
                    functions, classes, and parameters automatically from their
                    usage. When you modify a function, parameter, or type,
                    VisualCoder++ updates all references to the modified item
                    automatically. </P>
               
               <P> VisualCoder++ eliminates most searching. Function names,
                    parameters, local variables, and member variables are
                    selectable from drop-down lists. Syntax errors are
                    significantly reduced. Data types are declared through
                    custom dialog boxes. Function prototypes, include
                    statements, semicolons, and braces are generated
                    automatically. </P>
               
               <P> VisualCoder++ v1.16 is priced at $99. A volume purchase plan
                    is also available. </P>

               <P>Desiderata Software has developed an inexpensive scripting
                    tool for Windows that automates many of the tedious,
                    time-consuming, and error-producing operations of Windows
                    3.1 and Windows 95 programming. </P>
               
               <P> Sample scripts included in the PowerScript package enable
                    full automation of multicomponent project builds in Visual
                    C++ or Borland C++, reducing the need to monitor the
                    process. </P>
               
               <P> PowerScript can be used to develop scripts for running
                    applications, finding existing windows on a desktop,
                    performing menu selections, filling in dialogue boxes or
                    edit controls, clicking buttons or list boxes, simulating
                    keyboard input, and waiting for operations to finish. </P>
               
               <P> The entire PowerScript package, including software for both
                    Windows 3.1 and Windows 95, sample scripts, and user's

               <P>Nombas, Inc. has released upgraded versions of their software
                    development tools, C Macro Language Toolkit and CEnvi Cmm
                    Interpreter 2.10, for creating application scripts and batch
                    files. Also, Nombas, Inc. has released its new web scripting
                    application, CMMCGI, allowing CGI authors to quickly and
                    easily create programs to handle information based on client
                    input. </P>
               
               <P> With the C Macro Language Toolkit and the CEnvi Cmm
                    Interpreter, automation utilities can be written across all
                    major PC operating system platforms. With CMMCGI, you can
                    develop a Cmm script that allows clients to search databases
                    on servers' machines, for example, or generate and return
                    invoices or product information requests in response to
                    clients' queries. With one generic interface that runs
                    across all supported platforms, there is no need for fine
                    tuning scripts when they are translated from one system to
                    another. </P>
               
               <P> Cmm is a streamlined version of C, and supports all of the
                    routines and operators in the standard C libraries (except
                    those dealing with memory and other aspects the Cmm
                    processor handles automatically). Cmm fits in just 64K. </P>
               
               <P> The Cmm Macro Language Toolkit costs $5,000; an Evaluation
                    Developer's Kit is also available for $499. The CEnvi Cmm
                    Interpreter, available for DOS, Windows, OS/2, and Windows
                    NT operating system platforms, is priced at $69 for a

                    generates native GUIs from a single design, and Visual
                    WorkShop for C++ 2.1 for the Solaris Desktop v2.5 Intel
                    Edition. ProWorks allows you to build application
                    user-interfaces on the Solaris platform, then deploy them on
                    Motif and Microsoft Windows, with native look-and-feel.
                    Visual WorkShop for C++ is used to develop complex
                    user-interfaces with reusable widgets. </P>
               
               <P> Developers' user-interface designs can be implemented in
                    either Motif or Microsoft Windows by presenting a
                    cross-platform set of widgets on the palette. The
                    cross-platform set of widgets are extensible, enabling the
                    reuse of third-party or custom in-house interface
                    components. GUI code built with these widgets can then be
                    generated for either platform. Code generated for Solaris
                    calls the Motif API, while code generated for Microsoft
                    Windows calls the Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) library,
                    ensuring portability. </P>

               <P>Gimpel Software has announced the release of FlexeLint v7
                    software. FlexeLint for C/C++ scans C and C++ programs and
                    reports on bugs, glitches, and inconsistencies. One feature
                    is inter-statement Value Tracking. Values assigned to auto
                    variables and data members of the this class (for member
                    functions) are recorded and/or deduced, and the information
                    is retained across statement boundaries. With Value
                    Tracking, the calls to a large number of standard functions
                    are checked in a variety of ways and these checks can be
                    extended to user functions including class member functions.
               </P>
               
               <P> FlexeLint for C/C++ is compatible with most major C/C++
                    compilers and their respective libraries. It is based on the
                    ARM (Annotated C++ Reference Manual, Ellis &amp; Stroustrup)
                    and tracks the ANSI/ISO X3J16 standardization process,
                    including templates and exceptions. </P>
               
               <P> FlexeLint comes with a 30-day, money-back guarantee. The
                    cost to license FlexeLint depends on the configuration that
                    is licensed. A one-user workstation license is $998, and a
                    one-user local area network (LAN) license is $1,998. Updates
                    are available at a lower cost to current users. </P>

               <P>R-Active Concepts has added Borland Delphi and Microsoft
                    Foundation Classes (MFC) code generation capabilities to
                    BetterState Pro, their graphical, state-machine design tool.
                    The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) and Borland Delphi
                    code generators support the development of object-oriented,
                    event-driven statecharts advocated by most object-oriented
                    design methodologies. </P>
               
               <P> The MFC code generator generates event handler procedures,
                    in line with the MFC event-driven programming style. The
                    Delphi code generator generates Delphi event handlers.
                    Statechart designs made with BS4VisualBasic can be ported
                    with little effort to MFC or Delphi, allowing rapid
                    prototyping and development in Visual Basic and easy
                    conversion of the underlying logic behind the front end
                    application to an MFC or Delphi development environment.
