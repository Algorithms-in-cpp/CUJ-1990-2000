<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0079_0046">Liant C++/Views Supports Macintosh, SGI, Windows NT, and DEC Alpha OSF/1<A name="0079_0046"></FONT></h4></P>
Liant Software has ported C++/Views, an application framework for developing multi-platform, native GUI applications in C++ to several additional platforms. C++/Views lets portable GUI applications be developed, and then deployed across multiple GUI platforms, without code modification. The new platforms supported by C++/Views include Macintosh, SGI, Windows NT, and DEC Alpha OSF/1. C++/Views also supports OSF/Motif (AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, and SUN OS), OS/2, and Windows.<P>
With C++/Views, developers can create one set of source code and resources for their applications, regardless of the number of platforms on which they want it to run. When compiled on each platform, the application will adhere to the native look and feel of that platform. Because the dimension of the display and user interface components on systems vary, C++/Views uses the Geometry Manager, a mechanism to preserve spatial relationships. The Geometry Manager automatically manages the size and portion of interface components within dialogs, letting the developer create an element and later resize it.<P>
C++/Views includes a library of 100 C++ classes including interface design, data management, event processing, and several higher-level interface classes including table, toolbar, and MDI classes. C++/Views also includes a visual development tool, C++/Views Constructor. C++/Views Constructor combines a class browser with a visual interface builder, which lets the user draw and test an interface, and then switch to editing the C++ source code within the same environment.<P>
The Windows/Windows NT, Macintosh, and OS/2 version of C++/Views are priced at $1,499. The SGI, DEC Alpha OSF/1, and other OSF/Motif versions are priced at $2,499. For more information contact <I>Liant Software, Framingham, MA; (508) 872-8700.</I><P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0079_0048">MetaWare Announces High C/C++ Compiler with DirectToSOM C++ for OS/2<A name="0079_0048"></FONT></h4></P>
MetaWare has announced the High C/C++ compiler with DirectToSOM C++ for OS/2. With DirectToSOM, C/C++ source code can be compiled with High C/C++ to create SOM-compatible binaries without writing Interface Definition Language (IDL) class descriptions. SOMobjects compiled with High C/C++ for OS/2 can interoperate with SOMobjects written in other languages.<P>
IBM's System Object Model (SOM) technology was developed to let programmers upgrade binary C++ libraries without having to recompile client source code.<P>
High C/C++ compilers include C++ exception handling (including nested exceptions), namespaces to avoid name clashes with third-party libraries, run-time type information (RTTI), and ANSI C++ casting notation to make C++ typecasts safer than Standard C notation. High C/C++ also provides OMF common areas for templates, virtual function tables, RTTI, and inline functions. High C/C++ also includes "thread-safe" libraries that can be used in multi-threaded applications. All library functions are documented as to whether or not they support reentracy. In addition, High C/C++ includes switches for "fine-tuning" function inlining, optimizations to produce executables for specific processors such as the Pentium, and support for long long types.<P>
The High C/C++ DirectToSOMC++ for OS/2 compiler is priced at $595. For more information contact <I>MetaWare Incorporated, 2161 Delaware Ave., Santa Cruz, CA 95060-5706; (408) 429-6382; FAX: (408) 429-9273; E-mail: techsales@metaware.com.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0079_0049">ACI Ships Object Master for Windows<A name="0079_0049"></FONT></h4></P>
ACI US, Inc. has begun shipping Object Master for Windows, an integrated, cross-platform programming tool for writing and organizing source code. Object Master for Windows lets C/C++ programmers write, edit, organize, and navigate through source code while using drag-and-drop Windows functions. Object Master integrates with Microsoft Visual C++, Symantec C++, Borland C/C++, and DOS compilers. Object Master can trigger compilations and receive errors without switching to the compiler environments.<P>
Object Master includes a source code editor, a project window, and a browser that lets users edit select pieces of code. In addition, Object Master has a Class Tree Window. Object-oriented programmers can view different parts of the Class Tree simultaneously by opening multiple windows.<P>
Object Master for Windows also parses each file as it is added to a project and includes it in a data dictionary. The data dictionary lists definitions and locations of named programming components such as classes, functions, fields, and data types. Once parsed, the information is automatically updated in the browser and editing windows. With a single keystroke, programmers can use template calls generated by Object Master to insert method or function arguments. In addition, Object Master color-codes and stylizes text for identification. Programmers can customize styles for each language element including functions, keywords, compiler directives, syntax errors, disable directives, and comments. Object Master also checks a file's syntax and lists errors in a window.<P>
Object Master for Windows is priced at $249. For more information contact <I>ACI US, Inc., 20883 Stevens Creek Blvd., Cupertino, CA 95014; (408) 252-4444; FAX: (408) 252-4829; AppleLink: D4444.</I><P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0079_0054">Aladdin Introduces HASPCard<A name="0079_0054"></FONT></h4></P>
Aladdin Software Security has introduced the HASPCard(tm). This PC expansion card combines a standard HASP software protection key with a parallel port, and provides enhanced security by having the key inside the PC. An internal connection makes HASP viable when external access to the parallel port is inconvenient or unavailable. Turnkey system vendors can now incorporate HASP protection as an integral part of their system. Finally, the internal HASPCard minimizes the risk that the card might be lost, damaged, or stolen.<P>
Since HASPCard functions like regular HASP keys, current HASP-protected applications will not need source code changes or recompilation to guarantee compatability with the card. Three types of HASP keys are available in HASPCard format: HASP-3, MemoHASP, and NetHASP.<P>
HASPCard is available for an increment of $18 per unit over current HASP implementations. For more information contact <I>Aladdin Software Security Inc., The Empire State Bldg., 350 5th Ave., Suite 7204, New York, NY 10118; (800) 223-4277 or (212) 564-5678; FAX: (212) 564-3377.</I><P>
