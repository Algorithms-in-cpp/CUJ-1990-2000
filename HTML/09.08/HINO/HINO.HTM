<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01EB_00F4">CUG348 8048 Disassembler/Z80 Assembler<A name="01EB_00F4"></FONT></h4></P>
Contributed by Michael G. Panas (CA), this volume includes two public domain programs: 8048 disassembler and Z80 assembler. 8048 disassembler generates an output file that contains Intel 8048 mnemonics from an 8048 binary input file. The output file can be reassembled by any Intel type assembler for 8048, such as a48 from Will Colley (CUG#219). The disassembler was developed under Microsoft C v5.1 on MS-DOS, and UNIX V Release 3.2. Z80 cross-assembler was developed based on Will Colly's a48 assembler. The assembler assembles the dialect of Z80 source code into Z80 object code. All assembler features are supported except relocation, linkage and macros. The assembler was developed and tested under Microsoft C v5.1 on MS-DOS, and Altos System V UNIX and Xenix 3.0. The distribution disk includes documentation, C source code, and executable code for UNIX and MS-DOS.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01EB_00F5">CUG349 Simulation Subroutine Set<A name="01EB_00F5"></FONT></h4></P>
Contributed by M.A. Pollatschek (Israel), a shareware package, Simulation Subroutine Set (SSS) is a library that makes writing a discrete event system simulation program in any high level language (C, Pascal, Basic, FORTRAN) as easy as using a dedicated simulation language such as GPSS, Simula, SIMSCRIPT, SIMAN, etc. Discrete event system simulation imitates interacting processes developing in time, usually involving random phenomena on a digital computer. Typical applications include maintenance scheduling, inventory policy, distribution design, manpower planning, advertising, analysis of operations, etc. The distribution disk includes an installation batch file, manual for library routines, tutorial for simulation using SSS library, and SSS libraries for Microsoft's Quick Basic, Quick C, Quick Pascal, FORTRAN, Turbo C, and Pascal. Due to the volume and MS-DOS specific nature of the program, libraries and manuals are archived by PKXARC.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01EB_00F6">CUG350 PCX Graphics Library<A name="01EB_00F6"></FONT></h4></P>
Ian Ashdown (Canada) has submitted a PCX Graphics Library, <I>PCX_LIB. PCX_LIB</I> is a library of functions for displaying and storing Zsoft's Paintbrush" PCX-format image files. It was developed expressly for release into the public domain. Fully commented ANSI C source code is provided for all functions, along with complete technical specifications for ZSoft's PCX image file format. Version 1.00A supports the display and storage of images on MS-DOS equipped with Hercules, CGA, EGA, MCGA, or VGA. SuperVGA and XGA display adapter are not supported in this release. The distribution disk contains documentation including PCX image file format specifications, <I>PCX_LIB</I> source code, demonstration programs, sample PCX image files, and a batch file to build the library under Microsoft v6.0. His article appears on page 89 of this issue.<P>
