<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01F1_00F5">Green Hills C++<A name="01F1_00F5"></FONT></h4></P>
Oasys has announced the availability of Green Hills C++ on the Sun-4 SPARC, DECstations/systems and the IBM RISC System/6000 versions of AT&amp;T C++ including v2.1, v2.0 and v1.2. Developers can specify the C++ version to be used. Green Hills C++ supports both cross and native development, with a C++ compiler for embedded systems targeting 680x0, 88000, i860 and 386 microprocessors. It also includes an ANSI C and Kernighan and Richie C compiler.<P>
Green Hills C++ has been validated using the Perennial Test Suites for C++ so developers can take advantage of commercial C++ class libraries and use existing C++ code. It includes the complex math and I/O stream class libraries in source code, royalty-free. The M++ class libraries are also available from Oasys. M++ handles matrices and arrays within C++. Green Hills C++ also supports the Classix libraries from Empathy.<P>
Green Hills C++ will be integrated with a true C++ debugger, MULTI, also developed by Green Hills Software. MULTI is a source-level debugger that supports debugging of C++, C, FORTRAN and Pascal in an X Windows environment.<P>
Oasys has integrated Green Hills C++ with cross development environments for 680x0, 88000, i860 and 386. It goes direct from source to assembly code, optimizing C++ source code without passing through a separate C compiler. The Oasys Assembler/Linker System processes C++ objects that are produced by the Green Hills Cross C++ compiler. No post-link step is required since the Assembler/Linker is fully aware of constructor and destructor functions in C++.<P>
Oasys provides Green Hills C++ on UNIX-based hosts, including Sun-4 SPARC, Sun-3, DECstation/systems, IBM RS6000, 386 UNIX/System V, and 88open compliant machines beginning at $1,400. Green Hills Cross C++ sells starting at $2,200 with a special offer for the C++ compiler and Assembler/Linker System starting at $3,200.<P>
