<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">New Art Technologies Unveils NA-Word Y2K Tool</FONT></H4>

<p>New Art Technologies has released NA-Word. NA-Word searches documents to locate, compare, or replace strings of specified text. Although Microsoft Word is used as an automation server, NA-Word can also process WordPerfect, Microsoft Works, HTML, Microsoft Write, and others supported by Microsoft Word. In addition, since NA-Word can process all ASCII (text) files, source code such as Java, COBOL, and C can be processed through NA-Word's intelligent filters.</p>

<p>NA-Word can process from one to n files at a time and has a file finder that can find files anywhere on your local/network drive.</p>

<p>NA-Word is part of the NA-Series re-engineering toolset, which enables finding and fixing non-Y2K-compliant date references in source code, spreadsheets, and data files.</p>

<p>NA-Word costs $225 for one to four copies. Site licenses are available.</p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Crossware Releases 8051 C Compiler</FONT></H4>

<p>Crossware has released a new version of its 8051 C Compiler that takes advantage of the multiple data pointers provided by Siemens, Dallas, and Amtel chips, and the arithmetic unit of the Siemens 80C517/80C537 chip to improve the performance of the generated code.</p>

<p>The standard 8051 microcontroller and the majority of its variants provide only a single 16-bit data pointer with which to access external data and program memory. Access to these memory areas can therefore often involve a large amount of memory swapping as the contents of this data pointer are saved, loaded with a new value, and later restored to the original value. The new Crossware compiler uses the multiple data pointers provided in the support chips to avoid this memory swapping and create faster and smaller code.</p>

<p>C8051NT costs &#163;460 with support for one memory model and &#163;700 with support for two memory models.8051PSDS-A costs &#163;280 with support for one memory model and &#163;520 with support for two memory models.</p>
