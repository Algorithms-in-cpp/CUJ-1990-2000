<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="009F_0062">CUG155 B-Tree<A name="009F_0062"></FONT></h4></P>
Michimasa Honma (Japan) has updated CUG#155 Btree Library programs (developed by Ray Swartz). The code conforms with ANSI C and is tested under MS-DOS using Turbo C v2.0. For testing purposes, utilities that generate random numbers and create a B-Tree are also added.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="009F_0063">CUG328 WTWG<A name="009F_0063"></FONT></h4></P>
Although WTWG, window routines for text and graphics, was introduced as a shareware package, David Blum (CA), the author of the package, has placed the C source code in the public domain. The volume now includes the source code for Turbo C v2.0 and Microsoft C v5.1.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="009F_0065">CUG335 Frankenstein Cross Assemblers<A name="009F_0065"></FONT></h4></P>
Mark Zenier (WA) has submitted a collection of cross-assemblers written in the combination of Yacc and C. Inspired by Will Colley's cross- assemblers (CUG #149, #219, #242, #267, #276), Zenier has created a series of cross-assemblers for 8- and 16-bit microcomputers; RCA 1802-1805, Signetics/Phillips 2650, Hitachi 6301-6303, 64180, Mos Technology/Rockwell 6502, Motorola 6805, 6809, 68hc11-6801-6800, Texas Instruments tms7000, Intel 8041-8048, 8051, 8085, 8096, Zilog Z8, Z80.<P>
The assemblers provide hex listing, symbol table listing, debug, and processor selection. The output source is similar to Colly's, with a few minor differences: the end statement syntax and extensions (the support for different character sets and the \ escapes in strings). The front end of each assembler is implemented using Yacc/Bison, while the back end is written in C. If you replace the front end, you will get a new cross-assembler. The package includes Yacc and C source code, documentation, testing input and output files, and makefile. The programs were developed and tested under UNIX/Xenix and MS-DOS systems. Turbo C v1.5 was used for MS-DOS. Yacc or Bison (CUG #285) is required to build an executable code.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="009F_0066">CUG336 EGAPAL/EDIPAL<A name="009F_0066"></FONT></h4></P>
This volume includes EGA graphics applications and utilities contributed by Scott Young (NH) and Marwan El-AUGI (FRANCE). Young has submitted a shareware package, EGAPAL, which is a series of programs allowing users to create EGA graphics images for the 640x350 and 16-color mode. EGAPAL includes a graphics image editor program that lets you select a color from the palette, draw an image on the screen, and save it. EGAPAL also includes a utility that converts the graphics image into a header file to be included in your C programs, and a library that loads a graphics image from disk of header files to the screen. The package includes a documentation and sample program. Turbo C is required. For registration, please contact the author (P.O. Box 1550 Section #8, Portsmouth, NH 03802).<P>
EI-AUGI has submitted a palette editor, EDIPAL, which allows the user to change the EGA palette and save it. Saving the new palette is implemented by not closing the graphics system, therefore the change is not permanent. (He is working on this problem.)<P>
