<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00A1_0062">UNIX System Laboratories Offers New Products<B><A name="00A1_0062"></B></FONT></h4></P>
UNIX System Laboratories is offerring the latest releases of its Open Look graphical user interface (GUI), Xwin graphical windowing system and Alex developer's tool software.<P>
Open Look GUI for UNIX System V Release 4, and Xwin graphical windowing system, USL's implementation of the X Window System ported to System V, are available individually or together. Together, they are offered as Graphics Services v4. Alex software, which is a language extension to X developer's tool, is available separately.<P>
Open Look GUI contains a customizable environment featuring icons, pushpins, pull-down menus, point-and-click desktop and file manager, and other utilities. Open Look GUI works with any implementation of the industry standard Massachusetts Institute of Technology X Window System Intrinsics Version X11R4.<P>
This release of Open Look offers realistic three-dimenstional visuals that provide enriched appearance and improved visual feedback to user input.It also enables users who choose not to use a mouse to traverse the screen by rising keyboard accelerators or navigational keys.Release 4 of Xwin includes support for multiple servers, allowing users to run a server in each virtual terminal or on multiple terminals connected to a single CPU.<P>
Graphic Services v4, Open Look GUI, and Xwin graphical windowing system are available now. Source licencing fees for Graphics Services v4 are $20,000 for the initial CPU. Current customers can upgrade through April 1, 1991 at a 50 percent discount.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00A1_0063">MIPS Introduces International RISC/OS<A name="00A1_0063"></FONT></h4></P>
MIPS Computer Systems has introduced an international version of its RISC/OS UNIX-based operating system. In addition, MIPS introduced a Japanese country kit, which provides users with a Japanese language interface for MIPS workstations and servers.<P>
RISC/OS 4.51 employs a layered design, making the system readily adaptable to various languages and simplifies the development required to internationalize applications. The lower layer provides functionality that is independent of any one specific language or culture. The upper layers serve as country kits that provide language and cultural-dependent interfaces.<P>
MIPS implemented its first localized country kit for Japan, including messages translated into Japanese for more than 130 UNIX commands. Country kits in other languages will follow. The kit provides a Japanese version of the X Window System terminal emulator, so Japanese characters can appear on display screens in the X Window System environment. The kit also provides a Japanese version of the EMACS text editor.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00A1_0065">Qtool Offers Code Analysis System<A name="00A1_0065"></FONT></h4></P>
CAS is an integrated, interactive tool system that will analyze, maintain, and enhance ANSI C and C++ on DOS. CAS, which is available from Qtool, works with any C compiler system. The system has four tools: a code browser, a text browser, a command line query utility, and a translator.<P>
The code browser helps programmers locate identifiers, defines, numbers, and include in a project with query results placed in a scrollable list. The text browser has built-in language capabilities and also allows hypertext-like database searching. You can trace function calls or identifier references across the project and also automatically trace include files. Both the text browser and code browser permit easy invocation of external editors and other tools. The command line query utility allows database queries from the command line similar to interactive querries from within the code browser.<P>
CAS is available for the PC compatible on DOS. The price is $100. For more information, <I>contact Qtool, 5814 SW Taylor, Portland, OR 97221, (503) 297-3583</I>.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00A1_0066">Fast Floating Point Library<A name="00A1_0066"></FONT></h4></P>
Triakis is now offering a library of C compatible functions called FFP (Fast Floating Point), a floating-point arithmetic method based on the sign-logarithm number system. The library operations, which can often rival a math coprocessor in speed, can broaden the appeal of an application program for users without special math hardware. The precision and exponent range of the numbers equal and slightly exceed standard single precision.<P>
Applications include general scientific computation, geometrical graphics, signal processing, simulation, and non-linear systems. The library includes transcendental functions, logarithm, exponential, and square root.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00A1_006D">Source Level Symbolic Debugger<B><A name="00A1_006D"></B></FONT></h4></P>
Sierra Systems has introduced QuickFix, a high-end C language source-level symbolic debugger for the 68000 family. The debugger's advanced hardware/software design complements the company's previous product, the Sierra C cross-development compiler for embedded applications.<P>
The debugger offers a quick-connecting parallel ROM communication cable, convenient multi-window display, and commands featuring a C-like syntax for extremely intuitive operation.<P>
QuickFix's high-speed performance can be attributed to the parallel ROM communications interface. The debugger has six display windows: Source Window, Register Window, Command Window, Data Display Window, Terminal Emulation Window, and Help Window.<P>
QuickFix command expressions follow C language syntax and semantics. Expressions can incorporate any C operator, including casts and functions calls. All local and global variables can be referenced by their symbolic names, and the stack trace can be examined to determine the exact function nesting. For repetitive operations, debugger commands can be grouped into macros or placed into batch command files.<P>
With QuickFix, programmers can observe, control, and modify embedded applications as they execute on the target system. The debugger can set breakpoints in either ROM or RAM, set watchpoints, display and modify register and memory contents, and trace program execution. Conditional breakpoints and code patching allow users to test bug fixes quickly and efficiently without recompiling and reloading the target program.<P>
The QuickFix debugger hosted on PC AT computers, including the target systems monitor in source form and ROM communication cable, costs $1,500 when purchased with the Sierra C Compiler. When purchased separately, QuickFix costs $1,750. For more information, <I>contact Sierra Systems, 6728 Evergreen Ave., Oakland, CA 94611, (415) 339-8200; FAX (415) 339-3844</I>.<P>
