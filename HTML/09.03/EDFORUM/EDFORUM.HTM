<A name="009D_0000"><A name="009D_0000">Greetings from the Land of Oz. That's what many Australians call their country, with their usual mixture of happy brashness and tongue-in-cheek self-deprecation. They call themselves Aussies, pronounced OZ-ees, not AW-sees &#151; which tells you why they claim Dorothy's dreamland as their own.<P>
I have been here just over a week now. Already, I am growing comfortable with driving on the left. I take it for granted that mine is the funny accent, not everyone else's. (Moving north to Massachusetts a decade ago gave me a taste of that experience.) I still marvel at swimming in the South Pacific when it is snowing back home. I never quite adjust to seeing Orion upside down or steering by the Southern Cross instead of the Little Dipper.<P>
My computers arrived intact. It took but an hour to locate power cords to get their batteries recharging. Within a day or two, I got the funny phone connector that put my modem back in touch with the world. Two days later, I had the cables I needed to drive the laser printers I'll be using here. My good friend John O'Brien, of Whitesmiths, Australia, gets credit for all those hardware successes.<P>
Software has been more of a problem, but not insurmountable. My e-mail now gets as far as John's computer across town. It is still a patchwork to get mail those last few kilometers. I paid an earl's ransom for Bitstream fonts that refuse to slide down a serial cable because they were installed with a parallel interface in mind. Twice I have made frantic calls to the U.S. to have someone read passages from manuals I thought I could leave behind.<P>
It is still a miracle to me how quickly I reestablished diplomatic relations with the other side of the world. Faxes, modems, second-day package delivery, MS-DOS, Windows, and UNIX all work much the same here as back home. Many things cost more, a very few cost less. Already, I am back in the business of editing and writing.<P>
Of course, I couldn't spend a year here without a lot of help back in Kansas. Look at all those other names on the masthead. They have to work that much harder because their editor is a bit further out of reach. I can look out my office window in our rented house on Mackenzie Point and watch surfers dashing into Tamarama Bay. Occasionally, that inspires a twinge of guilt that my decision to come here has demanded so much help from others. (Only occasionally, mind you.)<P>
There's no place like home, to be sure. But it's also nice to go over the rainbow at least once in your life.<P>
