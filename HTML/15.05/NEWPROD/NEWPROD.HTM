               <p>Desiderata Software has announced the
                    release of PluginMaker, a tool for creating plug-ins for
                    Netscape Navigator. PluginMaker, which requires Visual C++
                    v4.0 or higher, can be used to create new plug-ins or to
                    provide a web interface for existing C++ or C code by
                    turning them into plug-ins. It is useful for developing
                    intranet applications, as well as internet applications. 
                    </p>
               
               <p> PluginMaker creates files that aid in
                    debugging and testing. PluginMaker makes it easy to process
                    data. Users can choose to process data a line at a time, in
                    fixed size blocks, raw as it arrives from Navigator, or
                    downloaded into a file. Java and JavaScript interfaces via
                    Live Connect are available. A plug-in installer is also
                    included in the PluginMaker package. </p>
               
               <p> The PluginMaker package sells for an
                    introductory price of $295, royalty-free. To download an
                    evaluation copy at no charge, visit Desiderata's web site at

               <p>SoundCode has released scCryptoEngine,
                    a cryptographic engine that provides a framework for
                    crypto-enabling any Windows 95 or NT application. The
                    engine, a set of C++ classes, supports the industry's
                    algorithms for symmetric encryption, public key encryption,
                    hashing, and digital signatures. </p>
               
               <p> With scCryptoEngine any level of
                    encryption is possible, from DES or Triple-DES private keys
                    ranging from 40-bits (exportable) to 168-bits (North America
                    only), and public keys ranging from 512-bits (exportable) to
                    2,048-bits (North America only). Integrated into Microsoft
                    Foundation Classes, the scCryptoEngine uses
                    Diffie-Hellman/ElGamal public key algorithms and digital 
                    signatures, as well as the Digital Signature Standard (DSS).
                    </p>
               
               <p> The scCryptoEngine is available as a
                    static library, DLL, or as a Microsoft Cryptographic Service
                    Provider (CSP). scCryptoEngine costs $230 for a
                    single-developer kit, $600 for a five-developer set, and
                    $760 for a ten-developer set. </p>

               <p>Softel vdm has released a new version
                    of its tab control. SftTabs/DLL 2.1 is a Windows custom
                    control, providing tab controls that can be used with
                    dialogs and with regular windows, picking up where
                    Microsoft's common controls left off. The included tab
                    design wizard allows the developer to create the desired tab
                    control look (including colors and bitmaps) and generate the

               <p> SftTabs/DLL supports development of "Wizard"-style
                    dialogs and similar multi-page dialogs, which can be
                    switched in response to other Windows controls (such as a

                    control). </p>
               
               <p> The product costs $329 (single

               <p>PKWARE, Inc. has announced the release
                    of the PXWARE Data Compression Library for DIGITAL UNIX. The
                    library routines are compatible with the 4.0 version of the
                    64-bit, UNIX-based operating system from Digital Equipment
                    Corporation. </p>
               
               <p> The library routines enable DIGITAL
                    UNIX software developers to incorporate compression directly
                    into their application. PKWARE Data Compression Library can
                    be used inside a database to make record storage more
                    efficient and for compression of data before sending
                    remotely via modem or internally via a LAN. Also, multiple
                    platform support by the library routines allows compression 
                    of data streams between systems where the operating systems
                    and processors may differ. </p>
               
               <p> Platforms supported by the library
                    include DOS, DOS32, Windows, Windows 32, OS/2, and UNIX

                    Ninety percent of all functionality is accessed through the
                    familiar property dialog user interface. The demo developer
                    controls all display and operational elements of the running
                    demo, without use of scripting. DemoShield5.1 also makes "end
                    user" demo distribution quick and painless with a
                    comprehensive Setup Wizard that allows quick installation
                    and uninstallation of demos, with automatic deletion of
                    files unloaded from the demo at time of termination. The
                    small 300K runtime is optimized for minimal memory
                    consumption to insure operation on most Windows systems
                    regardless of restrictions in available memory.</p>

               <h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Blinkinc's Shrinker Features Direct Execution </FONT></H4>
               
               <p>Blinkinc has released Shrinker 2.1, a
                    compression and archiving product that improves network
                    performance, minimizes distribution and storage costs, and
                    protects valuable software from decompilers. Shrinker 2.1
                    compresses 16-bit and real mode DOS programs by 60% or more.
                    These programs execute directly, with no separate
                    decompression step. Any EXE, DLL, or OCX compressed with
                    Shrinker will transparently decompress itself into memory at
                    run time. There is no separate decompression step, so the
                    end-user never has to know it has been shrunk. EXEs
                    compressed with Shrinker often load faster as a because of
                    their reduced size, resulting in no degradation of run-time
                    performance. </p>
               
               <p> A 32-bit version of Shrinker,
                    Shrinker 3.0, was scheduled for release near the time of
                    this issue's printing. For more information about Shrinker,
                    or to check on the availability of version 3.0, contact
