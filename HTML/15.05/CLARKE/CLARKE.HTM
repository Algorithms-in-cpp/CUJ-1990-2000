               <p>So you're starting to do Java. Maybe I
                    can save you some time and money with capsule opinions on
                    some recent Java books I've been using. Included are
                    tutorials I used when just learning and references I keep
                    handy when I'm cutting code.</p></BLOCKQUOTE>

                         Title: Java in a Nutshell
                         <BR> Author: David Flanagan
                         <BR> Publisher: O' Reilly &amp; Associates, 1996.

               <p>This little gem is a must-have &#151;
                    packed with information, not fluff. At $19.95 I consider it
                    a great bargain. A good tutorial spans several chapters,
                    including one aptly titled "Java vs. C," and one
                    on objects as used in Java. This book contains lots of code
                    fragments, which is good, though they're a little elaborate
                    for my taste. I like examples stripped to bare bones and
                    tightly focused on a single point. The reference section
                    gives an excellent introduction to each package (Java's
                    equivalent of a library) and then an introduction to each
                    class in the package. Alas, the class members are just
                    listed, not explained. The function and parameter names are
                    mostly self-explanatory, but I expect to use a reference to
                    be sure of the details. The indexes are worth the price of
                    the book &#151; among those included: Class Defined in Index,
                    Method Defined in Index, and particularly, Returned by Index
                    and Thrown by Index. On the down side, this book covers
                    Version 1.0, even though their web site provides updates. At
                    least, they're up-front about it &#151; the version's on the
                    cover.</p>

               <p>Really, very good, this book began
                    life as an HTML document, as the very extensive cross
                    references show. The book includes code snippets throughout
                    the text, then lists complete code for the programs in an
                    appendix and again on the obligatory CD-ROM. Clear
                    explanations cover the language itself and a good,
                    representative sample of what's in the packages. This book
                    is not an introduction to programming &#151; it assumes a solid
                    knowledge of C, and you'll get through the object-oriented
                    stuff a lot easier if you know C++. Like too many recent
                    books, this book also contains lots of information-free
                    padding.</p>

               <p>This book is not nearly as impressive
                    on my desk as it seemed in the bookstore. The language is
                    introduced in four repetitive, nearly identical chapters: "The
                    Java Language," "Java for C++ Programmers," "Java
                    for Delphi Programmers," and "Java for Visual
                    Basic Programmers." There's much good information in
                    the next 500 or so pages, but repetitiveness, padding, and
                    fluff continue. The short chapter on databases contains
                    information I hadn't seen elsewhere, but half its length is
                    consumed explaining databases. Finally, about 9/16 of the
                    book is a reference to the Java packages. A stylized format
                    and silly icons contribute bulk without adding information. 
                    The few code fragments don't help. The book seems to
                    accurately reflect Version 1.0.2, though I couldn't find
                    that stated anywhere. Don't you wish publishers would
                    replace some of their marketing MBAs with editors? One
                    novelty is bylines to indicate which author wrote which
                    section.</p>

               <p>If you're a serious Java programmer,
                    get this book. It's exactly what its title claims. First
                    come brief introductions to each package with their
                    hierarchy diagrams. The rest of this mammoth book is
                    composed of descriptions of the classes and their members.
                    The descriptions are organized alphabetically by class, not
                    by package, then alphabetically by member &#151; a much more 
                    convenient arrangement. The explanations are detailed and
                    thorough, and there's lots of good example code. Very well
                    written and very useful.</p>

                    those not associated with the GUI. Authoritative but
                    disappointing. Gosling is a better language designer than
                    author. Not a great tutorial, but not quite a reference
                    either. If you have a couple of good tutorials and the
                    Language Specification, you can skip this book and get by
                    just fine.</p>
