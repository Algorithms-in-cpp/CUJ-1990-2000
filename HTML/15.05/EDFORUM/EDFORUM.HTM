               <P> It's another sunny but chill morning
                    in Tokyo. My wife Tana and I are here to celebrate the
                    fifteenth anniversary of the founding of Advanced Data
                    Controls Corp., the company that has represented my
                    interests in Japan so well since its inception. Personally,
                    I'm on my second company, after a stint as an independent
                    writer. ADaC is still going strong in its original form.
                    </p>
               
               <p> Japan makes a comfortable sojourn,
                    after two dozen visits. I have my regular pilgrimages &#151;
                    Sanjusangendo in Kyoto, the Dempoin Garden in Asakusa. I
                    have my little rituals &#151; tea, yogurt, and croissants
                    overlooking the New Otani garden. Meditating upon these
                    beautifully preserved jewels, it would be easy to convince
                    myself that Japan remains unchanged over the decades and
                    centuries. </p>
               
               <p> But that is simply not the case. On
                    this visit, I gave a talk on the Java to C translator I'm
                    writing. I undertook this interesting project not on a
                    personal whim, my usual driving force, but because the folks
                    at ADaC asked me to do so. Once upon a time, they sold
                    whatever I offered up for sale. Now they represent a host of
                    different companies. They make their own products. And they
                    even commission an occasional work from the likes of me.
                    </p>
               
               <p> ADaC is not alone in being newly
                    assertive. I've written earlier in these pages about the
                    Embedded C++ Technical Committee. (See the Editor's Forum,
                    CUJ, November and December 1996. Also see my article on
                    "Embedded C++,'' CUJ, February 1997.) Well, they're now
                    being inundated with requests to join from companies in
                    Europe and the USA. They weigh carefully the inevitable
                    requests to add features to the dialect they've designed.
                    Put simply, here's a Japanese organization that's taking an
                    active role in determining the software tools that are
                    available to Japanese software developers. </p>
               
               <p> Generalizations are always dangerous,
                    particularly about entire cultures. I avoid any sweeping
                    conclusions from the anecdotal evidence. But I'm happy to
                    see my Japanese friends and colleagues enjoying their recent
                    successes. They're making technology that will benefit all
                    of us who produce code for a living, directly or indirectly.
