               <p>Mike Benzinger saw Don Retzlaff's
                    C/C++-to-HTML converter in CUJ ("C/C++ Source to HTML
                    Converter," October 1996) and decided to improve on the
                    idea. The result is cpptohtm.cpp and, lo and behold, we got
                    color. Mike writes: </p>
               
               <P><I> Don and CUJ, </p>
               
               <p> I read with interest your article on
                    converting C/C++ to HMTL. Since I have just started a rather
                    large C++ project at my office and we are using a local web
                    site to distribute information to our entire project team,
                    this article was rather timely. Now instead of printing
                    copies of code for distribution to the entire team, I can
                    post the code for code walk-throughs and reference 
                    consultation. In this way, anyone who wants a hard copy can
                    print it. While I liked your initial idea, I took it and ran
                    a little farther. </p>
               
               <p> You will find an attachment that has
                    some enhancements to your initial idea. I have added a touch
                    of color. C/C++ keywords are bolded and blue; comments are
                    italic and green. The code also lets you add hypertext links
                    for include files. </p>
               
               <p> The only caveat is that I used Rogue
                    Wave classes in developing the code, since the C++ Standard
                    has not been finalized and all compilers do not provide STL.
                    Please give me any comments you have and feel free to
                    distribute and modify the code as you see fit. Note also
                    that the code was written with a tilt towards Microsoft
                    Visual C++ 4.2.</p>

                    for comparison, is the same source code run through the
                    Retzlaff filter. The source and executable are available in
                    this month's source archives (see p. 3 for details). Thanks
                    to Mike for sharing the code with us &#151; and, of course,
                    thanks to Don Retzlaff for the original idea. &#151; mb </p>
