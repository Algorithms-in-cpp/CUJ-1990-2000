               <p>BSD UNIX sockets have been growing in
                    popularity since their first appearance in the 4.1cBSD UNIX
                    release for DEC VAX-11 in 1982. Today, sockets can be found
                    in nearly all BSD derivatives and even in MS-Windows. BSD
                    sockets emulate file descriptors as an extension of the UNIX
                    file I/O system. Accordingly, you can call the standard
                    library functions, such as read and write, to receive and
                    transmit data. Since  network communications requires more
                    control than the file descriptor functions alone can
                    provide, several new functions were added. For example,
                    establishing a connection requires details about hosts,
                    ports, protocols, and other options that simply cannot be
                    expressed by open alone. For a brief overview of BSD
                    sockets, see "Programming with Sockets," by Marco
                    Tomassini in the September 1991 issue of The C Users
                    Journal, Vol. 9, No. 9, pp. 39-56.</p>
               
               <p>Socket++, by Gnanasekaran Swaminathan
                    (Centreville, VA), is an iostream-like class for UNIX and
                    inet sockets, pipes, and socketpairs. Socket++ classes can
                    be used more effectively than directly calling the
                    underlying low-level system functions. Since Socket++ has
                    the same interface as the LibG++ iostream (i.e. like cout
                    and cin), it automatically performs type-safe input and
                    output. Even though Socket++ is very  easy to use, it still
                    supports a full complement of socket options including:
                    error reporting, debug mode, keepalives, routing, broadcast
                    datagrams, out-of-band data, and buffer resizing. Socket++
                    includes a mechanism for handling timeouts gracefully as
                    well. Socket++ runs on many UNIX platforms including Sun
                    Sparc, IBM RS/6000, DECstation, and SGI Indigo boxes.</p>
               
               <p>I recently wrote to Swaminathan and
                    asked him if he had any plans to port Socket++ to Windows
                    NT. He replied that he didnt have access to Windows NT but
                    that anyone who volunteered to do the port would be welcome.
                    If you would like to do the port, please write to &lt;sekar@nexen.com&gt;

               <p>Since the introduction of Windows 95,
                    the first version of MS-Windows to ship Windows Sockets
                    (Winsock) out-of-the box, there has been a tremendous
                    groundswell of Internet applications for the PC. The success
                    of the Winsock standard is also due to the multi-vendor
                    Winsock Committee which tailored a uniform Windows
                    derivation out of the BSD UNIX standard.</p>
               
               <p>The "WinSock Software Development
                    Tools" page maintained by Harold A. Driscoll &lt;winsock@driscoll.chi.il.us&gt;
                    of the Chicago Computer Society pulls together many of the
                    diverse freeware and shareware Winsock application toolkits
                    now available. Though sockets are an important part of
                    Internet development, the real meat of an application lies
                    in its implemention of key Internet protocols. Tools listed
                    on Driscolls page support the gamut of protocols, including:
                    Telnet, FTP, RSH (Remote SHell), RCP (Remote Copy) and
                    others. Many of these can be used with C, C++, and
                    VisualBasic.</p>

               <p>The very latest trend in Internet
                    development tools is of course the ActiveX platform for
                    Windows 95 and Windows NT. Microsofts "Activex"
                    (the API formerly known as "OLE Controls" or "OCX")
                    provides a clean and easy-to-use method of dynamically
                    accessing controls on web browsers. In this case, a control
                    is any child window which can display data obtained over the
                    web. Typical examples include Virtual Reality Markup
                    Language (VRML) viewers and real-time audio players. For the
                    best ActiveX applications (and the best overall assortment
                    of Winsock apps), visit Forest Strouds legendary "Consummate
                    Winsock Applications" page. This site is one of the few
                    bookmarked pages on my browser:</p>

                    immediately to the Microsoft "ActiveX Resource Area."
                    Here you can register as an ActiveX developer, download free

               <p>The Debug Malloc Library (dmalloc)
                    library has been designed as a drop-in replacement for the
                    systems malloc, realloc, calloc, free, and other memory
                    management routines while providing powerful debugging
                    facilities configurable at run time. These facilities
                    include such things as memory-leak tracking, fencepost write
                    detection, file/line number reporting, and general logging
                    of statistics. The library is  highy portable and claims
                    usability on least the following operating systems: AIX,
                    BSDI, DG/UX, HPUX, Irix, Linux, MS-DOS, OSF, Solaris, SunOS,
                    and Ultrix. dmalloc is distributed as shareware and requires
                    a $35 fee for use beyond the evaluation period. See:</p>

               <p>TracePlus32/Winsock actually fulfills
                    both the focus on Internet and on debugging.
                    TracePlus32/Winsock along with TracePlus32/ODBC, and
                    TracePlus32/SQLServer are three API spy utilities which
                    display all API calls from applications to the Windows
                    Sockets (see Fig. 1), Open DataBase Connectivity (ODBC), and
                    MS SQLServer APIs respectively. Whether youre calling these
                    API functions directly, using a third-party library, or
                    simply trying to reverse-engineer an application, youll find
                    them invaluable. In some cases, such as debugging a
                    client/server application with a UNIX database server, you
                    may wish to run both TracePlus/Winsock and TracePlus/ODBC
                    simultaneously. All of the TracePlus utilities provide
                    extremely flexible customization at a fraction of the cost
                    of similar commercial products.</p>

                    available for C++ purists. There are many books available
                    which will instruct you on the uses of YACC family parser
                    generators, including Compilers:  Principles, Techniques,

               <p>For straight ISAM functionality, I
                    recommend Nildrams ISAM Manager. ISAM Manager is a database
                    management library for C++ programmers. It offers a complete
                    and efficient ISAM system with B+Tree indexes that provides
                    a very straightforward interface to the developer. ISAM
                    Manager can handle very large and complex applications: up
                    to 2 billion records per file, 30 indexes per file, and 10
                    fields per index.  ISAM Manager is available in single-user
                    (stand-alone) and multi-user (network file sharing)
                    configurations. Internal index caching (single-user version
                    only) allows the most recently used indexes to stay in
                    memory. ISAM Manager also includes a program generator to
                    produce default data entry screens. It is highly portable
                    and has been compiled and tested on MS-DOS, Windows, and
                    OS/2.</p>

               <p>You might also consider MetaKit for
                    persistent data storage. MetaKit is a compact class library
                    for data storage and easy manipulation of structured objects
                    and collections in C++. MetaKit works with any C++ compiler
                    that supports Microsoft Foundation Classes, including VC++,
                    Borland C++, and Symantec C++. MetaKit allows your data to
                    be loaded on demand, which allows you access to any size
                    files. It uses  traditional database metaphors of begin
                    work/commit work/rollback work with automatic file storage
                    allocation and reclamation. MetaKit allows data to be "flattened"
                    for efficient streaming over sockets and pipes. It
                    encapsulates data in terms of view, row, and property
                    classes. Data can be conveniently accessed via [] and () by
                    operator overloading. Applications can statically link
                    MetaKit or load it as a DLL. MetaKit does not use ISAM or
                    B+Trees, however it uses intelligent flat-file management
                    with adaptive denormalization to achieve ISAM speeds.</p>

               <p>By far the most portable and complete
                    implementation of Scrabble is Chapman and Badhams XScrabble.
                    This is a full multiplayer (1-4) implementation of the
                    classic board game, with multilevel computer players, and
                    114,000 word dictionary (the Official Scrabble Players
                    Dictionary.) Features include high score table, handy setup
                    window, and load/save facilities. This program requires
                    X-Windows; a port to Linux  should be available by the time
                    you read this (The source code is available too).</p>
