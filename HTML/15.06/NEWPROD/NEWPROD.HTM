               <p>StratosWare Corporation has announced
                    MemCheck 5.0 for Windows, a runtime error detection tool for
                    applications running under Windows 95 and Windows NT.
                    Immediately after installation, MemCheck 5.0 can check any
                    32-bit Windows executable on the target system. As the
                    application runs, MemCheck 5.0 monitors its interaction with
                    Windows, detecting and diagnosing heap corruption, Win32 API
                    parameter errors, invalid GDI/USER/KERNEL handles, memory
                    pointers, memory and resource leakage, and unhandled
                    exceptions. No relinking of the target application or debug
                    information is required. </p>

               <p>QES has introduced a new testing
                    package called QES/Win EZ, which offers testing and quality
                    assurance without programming or scripting. The QES/Win EZ
                    package comes with a variety of features. It captures test
                    cases that test instantly. It automatically captures all
                    keyboard or mouse operations and replays with automatic
                    comparison and timing. It builds visually accurate interface
                    and process models of an application that anyone can view,
                    manage, and maintain without programming. And it captures
                    standard and non-standard controls. It replaces old test
                    data with new result data. </p>
               
               <p> QES/Win EZ comes with a 30-day,

               <BR> Software Research Announces TCAT for Java</FONT></H4>
               
               <p>Software Research, Inc. has announced
                    TCAT for Java, a coverage analyzer that reviews a coverage
                    trace and presents the results in graphic, textual, and
                    tabular reports. </p>
               
               <p> TCAT for Java provides both branch
                    and method-invocation (call-pair) coverage in a single test
                    run to identify which part of a Java applet's code has been
                    tested, both at the unit/object level and the system
                    integration level. Branch coverage is used for unit and
                    system testing, tracking the number of times each segment of
                    a method has been exercised. Call-pair coverage tests
                    integration by determining if each method invocation has
                    been exercised. Testers can then efficiently concentrate on
                    untested code, reducing the likelihood of defects and
                    improving product quality. </p>

               <p>i-Logix Inc. has introduced Rhapsody,
                    an object-oriented analysis, design, and implementation
                    tool. Rhapsody's toolset includes Rhapsody Designer, Code
                    Generator, and Animator. Rhapsody Designer, a graphical
                    implementation of the Unified Modeling Language, allows
                    developers to create design diagrams such as Object Model
                    Diagrams and Statecharts that incorporate composite objects,
                    concurrency, inherited Statecharts, and other embedded
                    constructs. Rhapsody Code Generator generates full,
                    optimized C++ production-quality code from object models
                    created in Designer, and includes more than 30 properties to
                    customize code generation to users' exact needs. Rhapsody
                    Animator, a debugging tool, allows developers to debug and
                    verify software at the graphic design level instead of the
                    compiler level. </p>

               <p>Hurricane Software has announced
                    WinGREP v3.0, a multi-file, search-and-replace utility.
                    WinGREP can be customized to automatically synchronize an
                    editor or IDE with the results of a search. Not only does it
                    open the file, but it will also position to the line of the
                    match. WinGREP also includes the ability to display the
                    results of a search in a developer's native working
                    environment. </p>
               
               <p> WinGREP's interface features a
                    hierarchical tree of search results. As the developer
                    highlights each match in the tree, the Quick-Preview window
                    shows several lines of text around the search match. This
                    allows results to be viewed in context with the code
                    surrounding it. </p>
               
               <p> WinGREP 3.0 costs $39; call for
                    volume pricing. </p>

               <p>NewMonics Inc. has announced PERC
                    virtual machine for sublicensing. By replacing Sun
                    Microsystem's Java virtual machine with the NewMonics
                    product, developers can take advantage of NewMonics'
                    real-time garbage collection technologies and ROM-targeting,
                    pre-runtime code optimizer. </p>
               
               <p> PERC's garbage collector
                    incrementally defragments memory by copying in-use objects
                    to contiguous memory locations to coalesce multiple small
                    free segments into larger free segments. It does this under
                    strict real-time execution constraints, enabling
                    high-priority application tasks to preempt the garbage
                    collector and offering throughout guarantees for the rate at
                    which each real-time activity's memory can be reclaimed and
                    reallocated. </p>

                    Developers can choose one or a combination of protection
                    schemes. The registration form, used in combination with
                    another feature, can be displayed to the end-user the first
                    time that an application is executed, or every time it is
                    executed if a correct password has not been entered.
                    Password protection can be used to prevent the end-user from
                    executing software unless a valid password is supplied.
                    Trial mode can be used to create a limited-use evaluation
                    version of the publisher's software. And a splash screen can
                    be displayed every time the software is executed, showing
                    copyright information, pricing and ordering information, or
