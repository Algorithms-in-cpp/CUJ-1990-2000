<BLOCKQUOTE>
If I am clearly standing in the kitchen, I can say that it is true that I am in the kitchen and false that I am in the living room. This kind of discrete, two-valued logic is called "crip" in Klir's book. If I move into the doorway between the kitchen and the living room, however, it becomes false to say that I am completely in either room. Although two-valued logic doesn't have a way of expressing my position in the doorway, fuzzy logic does. Fuzzy logic says it is half true that I am in the bedroom and half true that I am in the kitchen. (It is also half true that I am in neither room.) What I have just described is a "fuzzy value." Fuzzy logic is a mathematical system that operates on fuzzy values and is analogous to Boolean logic, which operates in discrete values. Fuzzy logic systems provide operators which are related to their Boolean counterparts (e.g. AND, OR, INVERT), as well as some that have no direct Boolen equivalent. For a more complete discussion of fuzzy logic, consult the sources I have listed in the Bibliography.<P>
