<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0331_0124">Systems &amp; Software Introduces SP/Tools<A name="0331_0124"></FONT></h4></P>
Systems &amp; Software, Inc. (SSI), has introduced its SP/Tools development tool set for 32-bit protected mode embedded applications for the Intel 386/486 series of processors utilizing C/C++. SP//Tools is made up of a series of components designed to work with the MetaWare High C/C++ compiler.<P>
The first tool, SP/Link, is a linker/locator that creates ROM-able code. SP/Link generates executable files for downloading to either one of SSI's debuggers. Depending upon the final application, a developer would use either SP/RTD 386, a DOS hosted remote target debugger that communicates directly to the target system via an RS-232 serial port or SP/RED 386, a source level ROM emulator debugger that allows downloading of a program from the host PC and debugging it directly on the 386/486 target system. SP/RED includes a Target Monitor to control program execution on the target unit as well as a virtual serial channel unit that operate through the target's ROM sockets.<P>
According to Dr. Y. P. Chien, Chairman of Systems and Software, Inc., "The rapid development and growth of the Intel 386 chip in the embedded marketplace, coupled with the use of C/C++ as the language of choice for embedded development, results in the need for a series of development tools that not only work with the processor/compiler combination, but also work well with it's own component parts. SP/Tools fills that need."<P>

Fidex Americas Corporation has annouced Software Security Service, a source code escrow service for independent software developers and their clients. Because software developers typically deliver only executables for the programs they produce, while retaining exclusive rights to the program sources, clients are at the mercy of events which damage the viability of the software developers. For developers relying increasingly on third party libaries and reusuable software components, the same problems arise. If product development ceases, users may be left without provisions for maintenance or enhancement of programs. The Software Security Service provides a mechanism to guarantee that a client's investment in custom software does not become worthless.<P>
When using the Software Security Service, the software developer deposits a copy of their source code with Fidex Americas Corporation. The source code is accompanied by a written agreement between the developer and client detailing the conditions or events that would trigger the release of the source code to the client. The deposited materials are stored by Fidex Americas in a climate-controlled subterranean vault. Such provisions can decrease some of the risks associated with use of third party software.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0331_013A">Software Development Systems Announces CrossCode C Release 5.4<A name="0331_013A"></FONT></h4></P>
Software Development Systems, Inc., (SDS), has announced a space optimization feature that is available in Release 5.4 of its 68000 Family C cross compiler, CrossCode C. In CrossCode C Release 5.4, the CrossCode C compiler generates code in such a way that each function removes its own arguments from the stack when called. The feature, called Called Function Cleanup, eliminates copies of the cleanup code in the calling functions and replaces them with one copy that's located within the function itself. According to the SDS, the Called Function Cleanup optimization reduces the size of a typical application by about 3%, describing such incremental improvement as significant due to the substantial optimization already found in compilers.<P>
Other features of CrossCode C Release 5.4 include: a register allocation scheme that places the most critical variables, addresses, and constants into registers, tail merging (i.e. eliminating duplication of identical copies of code at the end of function), compact, high speed "switch" algorithms, and a tracking mechanism that prevents the compiler from unnecessarily reloading registers. SDS describes the cummulative impact of its recent optimizations as an overall reduction in code size and speed by 12 to 21%. CrossCode C supports MS-DOS and SUN4/UNIX. Prices for CrossCode C start at $2,000.
