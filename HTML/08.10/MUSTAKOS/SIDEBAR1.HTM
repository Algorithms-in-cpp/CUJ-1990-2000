<h4>Process Control </FONT></h4></P>
<UL><li>Start a simulated process. 
<li>Stop a simulated process. 
<li>Wait for a certain interval of simulation time to pass.
<li>Wait until a certain simulation time. </UL>
<h4>Process Synchronization </FONT></h4></P>
<UL><li>Wait for a named signal from another process.
<li>Check for a named signal from another process.
<li>Send a named signal to another process.</UL>
<h4>User Interaction</FONT></h4></P>
<UL><li>Provide for a dedicated user interface process.
<li>Provide for process to request user input.
<li>Processing should halt at the first possible time for user input.</UL>

<h4>Data Hiding</FONT></h4></P>
<UL><li>Programmer may access, but not change simulation time.
<li>Simulation structures and variables should not be visible to the users program.</UL>

<h4>Miscellaneous</FONT></h4></P>
<UL><li>Simulation should run at some ratio to real time for human viewing and interaction, or at the processor's speed for efficiency.
<li>Pass a block of memory to another process.</UL>
