<A name="023B_0000"><A name="023B_0000">Over the years many C programmers have asked us to sponsor a C "get - together" &#151; a meeting or seminar where our readers and writers could talk and learn together. For one reason or another (usually time and money), we've been unable to put together a meeting worthy of the name "National C Users Conference". That's changed.<P>
I'm pleased to announce C-FORUM '90 &#151; a national conference and seminar exclusively for C programmers. As a co-sponsor (with the Wang Institute of Boston Unversity), we're deeply involved with making C-FORUM '90 the best (not the biggest) C event of the year. The conference will run from October 16th to 19th in Tyngsboro, MA (about 30 minutes north of Boston).<P>
We've tried to bring together the best talent available. P.J. Plauger is serving as technical chair. Brian Kernighan will give the keynote address. You'll also have the chance to hear and meet Tom Plum, Rex Jaeschke, Jim Brodie, Larry Constantine, Jack Purdum, and many other reknowned programmers and writers.<P>
The day before the show, Jack Purdum and I will teach an optional day-long C tutorial for programmers new to C who want to shorten the learning curve. The conference proper offers several tracks of seminars covering a wide range of C topics (see page 114 for more details). In addition to the teaching seminars, we'll have round-table discussions and presentations by technical representatives from the major compiler and tool vendors. You'll also be able to meet with select vendors at their booths in the trade show.<P>
Of course, <I>The C Users Journal</I> will have a booth, and when I'm not conducting a seminar, I'll probably be there, so you can stop by and tell me, face to face, what you think. Better yet, you can tell our new editor P.J. Plauger.<P>
In short, C-FORUM '90 is an unprecedented opportunity to work with the leaders in our industry. We want you to attend. To make it easier, we've arranged a $100 price break for C <I>Users Journal</I> subscribers. Just mention that you are a subscriber when you register.<P>
I look forward to seeing you there.<P>
Sincerely yours,<P>
Robert Ward, Publisher<P>
