<B>Q</B><P>
I would be very glad if you could help me with a preprocessor problem.<P>
I am trying to keep all external variables in just one .<I>H </I>file. The preprocessor should then produce the appropriate declarations in the main file and the external references in all other modules. This works just fine so far (<A href="list1.htm">Listing 1</a>)
.</FONT></FONT><P>
The problem arises as soon as I would like to initialize an external variable in the .<I>H</I><I> </I>file. A program line in the .<I>H</I> file like</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><P>
<pre>EXTERN i = 5 ;</pre>
leads to a link error saying "symbol defined more than once" (MSC 5.1). It would be nice collecting all global variables in just one<P>
<pre>int i = 5 ;</pre>
in the main file and<P>
<pre>extern int i ;</pre>
in all other modules.<P>
One solution could be :<P>
<pre> #ifdef MAIN
 int i = 5 ;
 #else
 extern int i ;
 #endif</pre>
but it isn't very elegant.<P>
Andreas Lang<P>

There is no write-once solution. In this regard, variable definitions and declarations are similar to functions and prototypes; you need to repeat the prototype, even though the function already is listed.<P>
I don't try to initialize in a header file, but I do include a copy of the header file in the source file where the variable is declared. For example, the header file would be:<P>
<pre>"extern.h"
extern int i;  /* External reference */</pre>
and the main source file would have:<P>
<pre>#include "extern. h"
int i = 5;   /* External definition */</pre>
You can have both an <I>extern</I> reference and a definition in the same source file and the compiler should check for agreement between them.</FONT></FONT><P>
<B>Q</B><P>
Using C library functions, how can I show on the screen the ASCII character for each of these seven control codes or hexadecimal values?<P>
<pre>BEL   07   CR  0d
BS   08   SUB  1a
HT   09   ESC  1b
LF   0a</pre>
I want to display the seven characters the way printed charts picture them. But with <I>printf()</I>, for example, I beep, backspace, tab, etc.</FONT></FONT><P>
Any suggestions would be welcome.<P>

<B>A</B><P>
The answer to your question depends on what you mean by "C library functions". ANSI standard library functions will not allow you to display these characters. Therefore, you must use compiler-dependent functions. Many compilers provide a version of the <I>putch()</I> function that will write directly to the screen (using the BIOS) without going through DOS. The function you need may be named <I>conout()</I> or something similar.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><P>
If your compiler does not have such a function, but does have a function that allows you to call interrupts (it might be called <I>sysint</I> or <I>int86</I> or intcall), you can build your own <I>conout()</I>. When calling the interrupt function, invoke <I>INT</I> <I>0X10</I> and set the <I>AH</I> register to <I>10</I> (output a character), <I>AL </I>to the character to output, <I>CX</I> to <I>1</I> (number of characters to output) and <I>BH</I> to <I>0</I> (display page &#151; normally <I>0</I>). Failing that, you could write the character directly into screen memory, using a properly initialized <I>far</I> pointer.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><P>

In the July 1990 of <I>The C Users Journal</I>, Larry Myers of Raleigh, North Carolina wrote you asking about stuffing character values into declared integer variables. You suggested he try the <I>memcpy()</I> function or bit shifting to achieve his ends.</FONT></FONT><P>
Using the <I>memcpy()</I> function brings a considerable amount of overhead into his program to do something so basic. And while bit shifting does the job, the resulting code is not self explanatory, nor is it portable across platforms that may use more than 16 bits as the size of an integer. Finally, neither method provides a sensible way of retrieving either of the newly stuffed character values from the integer storage location.</FONT></FONT><P>
I might have suggested the use of a <I>union</I> instead. It uses no extra overhead as does a function, it is immediately understandable to anyone having to maintain the code later, it is independent of either character or integer size, and it provides easy access to the character values after storage.</FONT></FONT><P>
I have provided a short test program (<A href="list2.htm">Listing 2</a>)
 and the associated output to illustrate. The <I>union</I> sets up memory storage to accommodate both an integer type variable and a character type variable, declared as an array of size two. In the IBM compatible world, this translates into a single two-byte memory allocation, which is defined as type <I>uSTUFF</I>. The two variable types overlap each other perfectly, and the <I>union</I> allows us to access either component individually, as well as readably.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><P>
One final thing Larry might remember is that the Intel 80X86 CPUs work with bytes of data in what is called "big endian" format (also referred to as a "left-to-right" architecture). Computers conforming to the "byte-addressable" model (and IBM PCs and compatibles do so) assume that the address of a variable type is the same as the address of the "first" byte of the variable, which is the byte lowest in memory (closest to memory location zero).<P>
In "big endian" format, the first byte of a variable is the highest order byte, which means that when we look at the variable in two-byte chunks, we see the lower order byte on the left and the higher order byte on the right. This is only important if Larry wants to treat the newly created stuffed <I>union</I> as an integer for calculation purposes. If so, then he must watch the order in which each character is stuffed into the <I>union</I>.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><P>

Thanks for your reply. I don't condone trying to play games with <I>chars</I> and <I>ints</I>. As you mention, it can be inherently nonportable. Although <I>memcpy</I> does bring in extra overhead, if you're only going to do it a few times, it won't hurt. For example, to match your listing, I would use <I>memcpy (&amp;iInteger, "AB", 2)</I> to copy the two bytes. If you are going to be doing this game a lot throughout your code, then using the <I>union</I> as you propose is a good idea.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0233_013E">Printers<A name="0233_013E"></FONT></h4></P>
I am an avid reader of <I>The C Users Journal</I>, and have been for a good three years now. As such I have always enjoyed your question and answer column. However, having just read the June 1990 issue I must make a comment on your column, as it seems to me that one of your answers is in error.<P>
First regarding the proper C statements to cause formatted output to go to the line printer: your answer gives the program in <A href="list3.htm">Listing 3</a>
and states that on MS-DOS that the line printer device is called <I>LST</I>.</FONT></FONT><P>
Although my experience with MS-DOS is actually with IBM PC- DOS (I have used several versions of it over the years on several different machines &#151; currently using PC<B>-</B>DOS 3.30 on a DTK PC/XT clone) rather than a generic MS-DOS &#151; I have not run into one which calls the printer device by that name. All that I have seen call it <I>PRN</I>, although you can also use <I>LPT1</I>, or <I>LPT2</I> or <I>LPT3</I> if you wish to be specific.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><P>
Anyway, I was puzzled by this so I tried your program with both Turbo C 2.0 and Microsoft QuickC 2.0 and found that both of them write their output to a file named <I>LST</I>, as I expected. If one opens the device <I>PRN</I>, however, the output does go to the parallel printer port, as desired:</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><P>
<pre>fopen ("PRN", "w");</pre>
A further "improvement" might be to dispense with the <I>fopen</I> and <I>fclose</I> calls entirely. This is easily done on MS-DOS systems (at least when using Turbo C or MS C) by writing to the standard printer device, stdprn:</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><P>
<pre>fprintf (stdprn, "The answer is %10d", z);</pre>
Both Turbo C and MS C provide an open <I>FILE</I> device by this name which points to the <I>PRN</I> device. The resulting program then becomes <A href="list4.htm">Listing 4</a>.
</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><P>
Please do not take this comment as being unduly critical of your column &#151; it is always very educational and well worth reading! (Besides this is probably about the hundredth such letter on this subject that you will receive!)<P>
Frederick C. Smith<br>
Stoneham, MA<P>
<I>Mea culpa</I>. Your's is not the only letter I've received. The <I>LST</I> name just came up in my memory slot and sounded so right. It happens that's the name on some compilers on some other systems. (Reader's are invited to guess which ones.) The MS-DOS device reserved names (all of which can be used in an <I>fopen</I>) are:</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><P>
<pre>CON console
AUX first serial port
COM1 " " "
COM2 second serial port
LPT1 first parallel printer
PRN first parallel printer
LPT2 second parallel printer
LPT3 third parallel printer
NUL dummy device</pre>
Although <I>stdprn</I> is "semi-standard", it's not ANSI standard, and therefore I tend to shy away from it. In addition to being ANSI incompatible, using <I>stdprn</I> makes it harder to change the output device. <A href="list5.htm">Listing 5</a>
shows how the function could be written using a variable passed to <I>fprintf</I>, rather than <I>stdprn</I>. This listing permits redirection to either the printer, a disk file (or other device listed above), or to the <I>NUL</I> file (a dummy device &#151; all output written to a <I>NUL</I> file is thrown away).</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><P>
<A href="list6.htm">Listing 6</a>
shows a portion of <A href="list5.htm">Listing 5</a>
rewritten to use the <I>stdprn</I> value that "might" be in <I>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</I>.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><P>
Along this same line, for some of our readers, let me review a little about file pointers. The ANSI standard states that there are three predefined file pointer values:<P>
<pre>stdin   standard input   /* Default: keyboard */
stdout  standard output  /* Default: screen */
stderr  standard error   /* Default: screen */</pre>
These three flies (or devices) are already opened when your C program begins. When you call <I>printf</I>, you are writing to <I>stdout</I>.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><P>
<pre>printf("Hello world\n");</pre>
is the same as:<P>
<pre>fprintf(stdout, "Hello world");</pre>
When you call <I>scanf</I>, you are reading from <I>stdin</I>.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><P>
<pre>int i;
scanf("%d",&amp;i );</pre>
is the same as:<P>
<pre>int i;
fscanf(stdin, "%d", &amp;i);</pre>
To write to the standard error output, you need to call fprintf, as:<P>
<pre>fprintf(stderr, "This is an error");</pre>
The <I>stderr</I> output is set to the screen and under MS-DOS cannot be redirected. It should only be used for those messages which are absolutely critical to be output. (KP)</FONT></FONT><P>
I refer to the Q and A column in the July, 1990 <I>C</I> <I>Users Journal</I>. Part two of the first question asks for a method of addressing a printer other than using <I>stdprn</I>. Your answer was, under MS-DOS, to use the <I>MODE</I> command to designate a printer as either <I>LPT1</I> or <I>LPT2</I>.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><P>
However, what do you do if you have two printers attached to one computer and you want to select them individually in your program? The answer was given to me by one of the technical people at Borland. You can select a printer, in your program, as follows:<P>
<pre>FILE *fp1;
FILE *fp2;

fp1 = fopen("LPT1", "wb");
fprintf(fp1,"Hello printer ONE!");
fclose(fp1);</pre>
If two printers are connected you can send output to the second printer with:<P>
<pre>fp2 = fopen("LPT2", "wb");
fprintf(fp2,"Hello, printer TWO!");
fclose(fp2);</pre>
As you can see each printer can be addressed as you would any file. In this case the file names are <I>LPT1</I> and <I>LPT2</I>.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><P>

Thanks for your reply. This is another possible reason for not using <I>stdprn</I>. The printers could be opened in either binary <I>wb</I> mode or text <I>w</I> mode, depending on how the printers are set up. The binary mode would not translate <I>\n</I> characters to <I>CR/LF</I> combinations, while the text mode would. (KP).</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><P>
In reference to your reply to Bill Whitcraft (<I>The C Users Journal</I>, Volume 8, No.6, page 73).<P>
Bill used <I>WRITELN</I> in Pascal, which automatically ends the line with a carriage return. C's <I>printf( ) </I>does not do this, so Bill should be advised to include the \<I>n</I> escape character.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0233_0140">FORTRAN And C<A name="0233_0140"></FONT></h4></P>
In response to Steve Nelson's letter in the June issue, about linking FORTRAN to C, there are several ways around this problem. (1) translate, (2) use externals, (3) buy compatible C and FORTRAN compilers and (4) have the client buy NKR Research's FORTRAN.<P>
My personal favorite is to use a FORTRAN to C translator. You can have the client do the translation or you can do it yourself. If you have the client do the translation you can lose control of the quality, but then you don't have to sign a lot of secrecy papers.<P>
The big draw back of using externals is that you will have to write a lot of new code. And you will have to do a lot of coordinating between you and your client. But you should have to do it only once.<P>
There are two companies that have compatible FORTRAN and C compiler that I know of &#151; Micro Way and Watcom. They are designed for the 32-bit processor.<P>
NKR Research claims that you can call from other languages without interfacing subroutines. I also got a similar response from Borland's Tech staff.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0233_0141">MS-DOS to UNIX Files<A name="0233_0141"></FONT></h4></P>
<I>The C Users Journal</I> is great &#151; one of my favorites, and I always enjoy your column! I have one comment however. Your reply to Jaspal Singh's question (Q?/A? June 1990) about extraneous carriage returns (<I>Control-Ms</I>) in MS-DOS files when they are moved onto a UNIX system was accurate and informative, but I think that there is a better solution than the little program given. Most UNIX shells provide a translate function (<I>tr</I>) that should take care of this quickly and efficiently. The command:</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><P>
<pre>tr -d '\015' &lt; msdos.file &gt; unix.file</pre>
will delete all <I>Control-Ms</I> from the MS-DOS file. And the sequence:</FONT></FONT><P>
<pre>tr -d '\015' &lt; msdos.file | tr '\032' '\004' &gt;
unix.file</pre>
should combine that with translation of the <I>Control-Z</I> (MS- DOS <I>EOF</I>) to <I>Control-D</I> (I have not actually tried this!). My apologies for the "bang-dash-dot-backslash" syntax so typical of UNIX. Some of your readers can probably point out a way of translating both characters in a single translate command that makes use of some arcane "feature" of the shell.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><P>
Ahhhh....isn't UNIX wonderful!! Perhaps there should be an "Obfuscated UNIX Command Line" Contest??<P>

In reference to your reply to Jaspal Singh, if the program is converted on the MS-DOS machine, here is a simpler solution! (<A href="list8.htm">Listing 8</a>)
<P>
I hope that this is useful to you.<P>
John Deurbrouck<br>
Mountlake Terrace, Washington<P>
Deurbrouck's program opens the input file in text mode and writes the output file in binary mode. On text mode input, CR/LF combinations are converted to single \<I>n</I>. On binary mode output, there is no conversion of the \<I>n</I>. His program does not remove the <I>EOF</I> (<I>control-Z</I>) character found in MSDOS text files. Depending on how you move the file, the <I>EOF</I> may not be a problem. (KP)</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0233_0142">Dynamic Linking<A name="0233_0142"></FONT></h4></P>
Your column in the July 1990 <I>C Users Journal</I> had a request for dynamic linking of C code on the IBM PC. The TopSpeed C compiler provides this in the current version; I wish Borland and Microsoft would follow suit. There is also an English compiler suite (Fortran and other languages) that I saw reviewed recently that has something similar; I'm at home now, and don't recall the exact company name offhand. The compiler review might have been in a recent issue of <I>Computer Language</I>.<P>
