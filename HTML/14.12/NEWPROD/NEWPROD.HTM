                +1 Software Engineering Releases TreeSoft/Base and TreeSoft/CM</FONT></H4>
               
               <p>+1 Software Engineering has released
                    TreeSoft/Base and TreeSoft/CM. TreeSoft/Base graphically
                    displays the calling structure of a program, including any
                    recursive routines. TreeSoft/Base provides a graphical way
                    to change the model, traverse the calling structure, and
                    edit or view a module's source code and documentation. When
                    compiling, TreeSoft/Base creates and runs the project's 
                    makefile, integrating archive libraries and compile options.
                    </p>
               
               <p> TreeSoft/CM, an advanced
                    configuration management system, supports identification,
                    variations, baselines, accounting, auditing, and access
                    control. TreeSoft/CM enhances the Source Code Control System
                    (SCCS), an automated configuration management tool. All
                    basic CM commands are supported, such as check-in and
                    check-out of a file and displaying differences between two
                    versions of a file. TreeSoft supports several predefined CM
                    reports and allows for customized reports. TreeSoft can
                    baseline a project, build version libraries, check out
                    previous versions of a file, delete the latest update, undo
                    previous check-outs, and maintain access control lists.
                    </p>
               
               <p> TreeSoft/Base and TreeSoft/CM each
                    cost $1,250 per floating license. TreeSoft runs on any Sun
                    Workstation running SunOS 4.1x, Solaris 1.x, or Solaris 2.x
                    supporting an OpenWindows, Motif, or Common Desktop

                Raima Releases Raima Object Manager 3.0</FONT></H4>
               
               <p>Raima Corporation has released Raima
                    Object Manager 3.0, a C++ class library that encapsulates
                    object storage and database navigation into C++ class
                    definitions. Object Manager includes an implementation of
                    member functions as server extensions for Velocis Database
                    Server, which allows application functions to be hosted on
                    the database server and access the server at a low level. 
                    Also, Object Manager supports access to the RDM and Velocis
                    "d_" C-API, enabling developers to call these
                    functions rather than Object Manager member classes when
                    appropriate.</p>
               
               <p> The functionality required to store
                    objects is built into the Object Manager base classes, and
                    Version 3.0 provides several new member functions included
                    in the TransAction class, as well as new member functions in
                    the storable object class that allow the use of different
                    keys. </p>

                ST Labs Opens Internet Testing Lab</FONT></H4>
               
               <p>To help Internet software developers
                    get quality products to market first in an increasingly
                    competitive industry, ST Labs, Inc. has opened a specially
                    equipped Internet lab. </p>
               
               <p> ST Labs, an outsourced software
                    testing company, has been successfully testing Internet
                    tools and Web-enabled applications for the last nine months
                    as part of its software testing services. Steadily
                    increasing demand for these services led to the creation of
                    the Internet lab which complements ST Labs' other testing
                    groups, including digital media and consumer titles, Windows
                     and networking applications, and client/server. To meet
                    customers' unique technical needs, the lab is outfitted with
                    the latest industry hardware, software, and data
                    transmission services. </p>
               
               <p> ST Labs' Internet experience includes
                    testing projects such as Microsoft's Internet Explorer, Type
                    On Call by Adobe Systems, Mosaic in a Box by
                    CompuServe/Spry, and others. </p>
               
               <p> The new Internet lab bases its server
                    testing procedures on Windows, PowerPC, and UNIX-based
                    hardware running Netscape and Microsoft Internet server
                    software. The lab also tests Windows for Workgroups, Windows
                    95, Windows NT, Macintosh 680X0, PowerPC, and UNIX-based
                    client configurations with the most popular browsers,
                    stacks, and plug-ins. Various connectivity methods are 
                    available, with or without firewalls, including direct Tl
                    access, dedicated plain old telephone service (POTS) lines,
                    and integrated services digital network (ISDN) lines.
