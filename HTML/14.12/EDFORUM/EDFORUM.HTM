               <p> Well, I finally did it. I joined the
                    teeming millions around the globe and put up a Web site.
                    Actually, my company Dinkumware, Ltd. did. And actually, we
                    engaged the services of someone rather more competent than I
                    at graphic design and Web arcana to do the magic bits. But
                    it's there, anyway. Go to http://www.dinkumware.com for a bo
                    peep, as they say in Sydney. </p>
               
               <p> I try to avoid being too crassly
                    commercial, at least when I wear my editor's or columnist's
                    hat. My major reason for mentioning this new site (aside
                    from some subliminal bragging) is to point out a resource
                    that may be of general interest to CUJ readers. In addition
                    to the usual promotional pieces on Dinkumware products, you
                    will find at that site three HTML reference manuals. One is 
                    on the Standard C library, one is on the Standard Template
                    Library, and one is on the complete draft Standard C++
                    library. </p>
               
               <p> The Standard C Library manual has a
                    separate page for each of the 18 headers in the Standard C
                    library. Yes, the number is 18, not 15, because the
                    description includes the facilities added with Amendment 1
                    to the C Standard approved in 1995. Additions are marked as
                    such, for those (many) of you who lack either access to or
                    interest in such new-fangled gewgaws. It also describes the 
                    additions to the Standard C library required by the draft
                    C++ Standard. They too are marked as such, to avoid any
                    confusion. </p>
               
               <p> The Standard Template Library manual
                    describes STL as it is being standardized. It is not just
                    another description of the code made freely available by
                    Hewlett-Packard. </p>
               
               <p> The draft Standard C++ Library manual
                    incorporates both of the above and a heckuva lot more. It
                    describes the complete library that is being standardized by
                    WG21/X3J16, in all its ambitious glory. If you think you
                    know all about iostreams, for example, you should browse
                    here for a spell. You might be surprised at what has been
                    added while you haven't been looking. </p>
               
               <p> It's a bit of a gamble making this
                    material freely accessible. We ask visitors not to copy the
                    manuals wholesale, since we make a living licensing
                    intellectual property of this sort. So far the site visitors
                    have been reasonably honest, I think, with a couple of
                    notable exceptions. Our hope is that by making available a
                    genuinely useful resource on the Web, we will get people to 
                    notice our commercial offerings as well. But like everyone
                    else doing business on this new frontier, we've still got
                    our fingers crossed.</p>
