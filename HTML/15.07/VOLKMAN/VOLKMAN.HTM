               <p>During the past 18 months that I've
                    been producing this column, interacting with readers has
                    been the most exciting part of the job. Helping people find
                    the everyday tools they need is much more fulfilling than
                    trying to guess what people "might" like to see.
                    From Italy to Japan, readers of this column and participants
                    in the C/C++ Users Group have written to me in desperate
                    need of a library or tool. Most of them are sure that the
                    tool in question is "out there" somewhere on the
                    Internet, but they have failed in frustration to find it
                    themselves. I don't claim to be more clever than these
                    folks, I just have a little more experience in knowing where
                    to start looking. </p>
               
               <p> Of course, I've replied to everyone
                    by e-mail prior to publication. But if you've got a better
                    link or tool to offer than what I've come up with, then by
                    all means send a brief e-mail. I anticipate that
                    reader-originated requests will become a growing segment of
                    this column. Read on; odds are you'll find something you've
                    been looking for or maybe gave up looking for.</p>

               <p>The C/C++ Users Group has been a major
                    influence in promoting user-supported software since 1981.
                    The CUG produces CD-ROM updates twice yearly which are
                    announced right here in the C/C++ Users Journal. Several of
                    this month's recommendations point to the CUG CD-ROM as well
                    as the Internet. I'll only mention once where to learn more
                    about it or find where to order it:</p>

                    code in the net, But I don't have large experience in C++.
                    I'm learning yet and most of them are missing some parts.
                    Any help will be welcome, thanks very much.</p>

                    theory objects. Grail converts readily between input

                    operations. Grail is written in C++ and can be accessed

                    library. It handles machines with up to 100,000 states and

               <p>There is a freely available program
                    called 'lclint' that does much the same thing as traditional
                    lint. The announcement and source code are available at</i></p>

               <p><i>The best prettyprinter with source is
                    of course GNU Indent. GNU Indent, from Joseph Arceneaux (San
                    Francisco, CA), becomes the newest installment of high
                    quality tools from the GNU project. The Indent program
                    changes the appearance of a C program by inserting or
                    deleting whitespace. </p>
               
               <p> The Indent program can be used to
                    make code easier to read or to convert from one style of
                    writing C to another. Indent understands a substantial
                    amount about the syntax of C, but it also attempts to cope
                    with incomplete and malformed syntax. Indent can replace the
                    original source .C file and retain a backup copy or else
                    write its output to a new .C file. See</i></p>

                    cross-platform development tools. You have not mentioned the
                    Amulet toolkit, so you might be interested in checking out

               <p>I have used both Amulet and wxWindows
                    (for some "toy" projects), and find Amulet to be
                    more user friendly and "abstract." A new version
                    has just been released, with interesting new features.
