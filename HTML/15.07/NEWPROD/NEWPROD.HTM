               <p>SYWARE, Inc. has announced Dr. DeeBee
                    ODBC Tools v3.0, a suite of utilities used to monitor the
                    operation of ODBC-enabled applications and drivers. With
                    Version 3.0 the tools Info, Peek, Timer, and Spy now support
                    both ODBC 2.x and 3.0. </p>
               
               <p> Dr. DeeBee Tools is a suite of seven
                    utilities: Check semantically checks ODBC applications at
                    runtime; Peek records ODBC calls made by an application;
                    Timer counts the number and length of ODBC calls an
                    application makes; Test runs regression tests on ODBC
                    drivers; Spy is a redistributable version of Peek for use by
                    product support organizations; Replay replays logs generated
                     by Spy; and Info displays description and characteristics
                    of a driver. </p>
               
               <p> Dr. DeeBee Tools are packaged in two
                    bundles: the Starter Bundle (Info, Peek, and Timer) costs

                    seven tools) costs $399 for 16-bit and $499 for 32-bit.

                    examples. Driver::Works supports Microsoft's Windows Driver
                    Model (WDM), ensuring that drivers built with Driver::Works
                    will be compatible with both Windows NT 4.0 and future
                    versions of Windows, including Windows 97. </p>
               
               <p> Driver::Works requires Windows NT

                    3.0, a charting widget used by UNIX and OpenVMS
                    user-interface developers, and Olectra Chart 5.0, adding
                    data binding, enhanced Internet support, and new native

               <p> Motif developers use XRT/graph to
                    build financial and scientific applications. Version 3.0
                    introduces new graph types including polar, radar,
                    filled-radar, hilow, hilowopenclose, candle; property pages
                    that let developers and end-users change graph properties at
                    design-time and runtime; enhanced bar charts; enhanced axis
                    labels; and CDE compliance. </p>
               
               <p> Using Olectra Chart 5.0, developers
                    can bind charts to any data source without writing a single
                    line of code. Charts bound to a data source become fully
                    data-aware and any updates in the data will be automatically
                    reflected in the chart. </p>

               <h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Bullseye Testing Releases C-Cover v3.2</FONT></H4>
               
               <p>Bullseye Testing Technology has
                    released C-Cover v3.2, a branch coverage analyzer for C++
                    and C that measures true branch coverage. In addition,
                    C-Cover can analyze multithreaded code, DLLs, device
                    drivers, and system-level code. A new feature allows
                    rebuilding and analyzing of an application without any
                    changes to the build procedure or to the application.

               <p> This release supports analyzing test
                    programs from within the Microsoft Developer Studio and
                    includes enhanced support for the Microsoft Foundation
                    Classes. Draft standard C++ and Microsoft language
                    extensions are fully supported, including templates,
                    exception handling, and namespaces. Runtime source code and
                    utility programs are included. </p>
               
               <p> C-Cover costs $800 for the first copy
                    and $700 for each additional copy. </p>
