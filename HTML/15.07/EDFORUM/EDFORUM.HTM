               <p>Maybe I shouldn't admit it, but I
                    still do much of my work typing command lines at a text-mode
                    shell. I run shell scripts and edit scripts all the time. I
                    lash together pipelines to do quickie one-off tasks. In
                    short, I am an unrepentant software tools junkie. </p>
               
               <p> Don't get me wrong. I really like the
                    WIMP interface (consisting of Windows, Icons, Menus, and a
                    Pointing Device). When you have a finite number of choices,
                    particularly ones you can't always remember, you can't beat
                    menus and icons as prompting aids. When you're performing
                    operations in two dimensions, such as moving around blocks
                    of text in an editor, you can't beat those windows and 
                    pointers. When a WIMP interface is good, it is very very
                    good. </p>
               
               <p> But when it is bad, it is horrid.
                    Sometimes it is simply easier to type a command than paw
                    through menus. I can't abide having to repeat long
                    point-and-click sequences to do jobs I know will be
                    performed often and unchanged. I make too many mistakes that
                    take hours to find and fix. Regression testing is really
                    lame in such an environment. I want exactly the same input, 
                    with automatic checking for exactly the same output, every
                    time. Sometimes you can build a decent script with an event
                    recorder, but not always. </p>
               
               <p> So a lot of the time, my pretty color
                    screen with all those pixels is tiled with multiple MS-DOS
                    and Unix sessions. White typewriter font on black
                    background, 25 lines of 80 characters. Multiprocessing for
                    me means compiling in one window while I edit files in
                    another and grep about at the command line in a third.
                    </p>
               
               <p> What bugs me the most is
                    inconsistencies. Returning to Unix after years of exile in
                    DOS-land has been an eye opener. I love the powerful
                    software tools, which were invented in early Unix. But I
                    hate the way they have proliferated versions over the years,
                    while nevertheless retaining as fossils all the early design
                    mistakes. And I really miss using keyboard arrows to flip 
                    quickly through commands typed earlier. </p>
               
               <p> I use the MKS Toolkit on Windows
                    systems, but I can't say it's always a productivity boon. It
                    slavishly imitates all of the flaws of the early Unix tools,
                    adding in the bargain all sorts of inconsistencies in the
                    handling of CR/LF, ctl-Z, and wildcard filenames. On top of
                    that, Windows NT is just different enough from Windows95 to
                    be a source of continual frustration. </p>
               
               <p> Over the last two decades, people
                    have asked me off and on why Brian Kernighan and I haven't
                    revisited Software Tools in yet another, more modern,
                    incarnation. We've thought about it from time to time, but
                    have never quite got it together to do the job. Besides, I
                    hate revisiting old themes. But every once in a while I
                    still kick myself for not having done so. If I'm going to 
                    remain a stone-age programmer, I sure could use a sharper
                    flint axe.</p>
