<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00C7_006B">Professional Input Validation<B></B> <B></B>for MS-Windows<A name="00C7_006B"></FONT></h4></P>
MantaSoft Partners have released InControl, a new set of DLLs, with source code available, that will enable programmers to include professional input validation in their Microsoft Windows 3.0 applications. These DLLs are compatible with Microsoft Windows SDK, Borland C++ 2.0, Borland Turbo Pascal for Windows, Whitewater's Actor and Microsoft Visual BASIC.<P>
InControl Toolbox defines thirteen new classes of controls for Microsoft Windows. The controls are broken into two logical groups: display and input. Display controls are used to display information to a user of a Windows application. Input controls are used to control the information that a user enters into a Windows application.<P>
InControl Toolbox contains two display controls. These are the Time control and the Date control. It contains 11 input controls. The input controls are broken into three groups: Formatted, Numeric and Free Format. The Formatted group contains controls which allow the input of Zip Codes, phone numbers, Social Security numbers and dates. There is also a programmer defined Formatted control that allows the programmer to define, at a character-by-character level, the allowable input for a given control. This control uses a dBase-like command string to describe the allowable input, if any, at a given position in the input control.<P>
The Numeric group contains controls that allow the entry of integers, floating point numbers and dollar amounts. Each of these controls allows the entry of negative numbers and has an option which allows the programmers to set a legal range of values.<P>
The Free Format group consists of two general entry controls. They are called general entry because they accept any input and, upon losing focus, try to determine if that input corresponds to a legal value. The first of these controls is the Free Format Date control. This control will try to determine what date the user meant from the given input. For example: a value of "F932" would yield the result "February 3, 1992" or "02/03/1992" depending on a style flag. Other allowable inputs are "Next Week", "Last Friday", "Today" and "Yesterday".<P>
The second general entry control is the Regular Expression control. This control uses a Grep-like regular expression to determine if the value intered by the user was a legal value.<P>
For each of the input controls, a programmer can assign a function that is called when the control loses focus. This routine can be used to further validate the data entered or to immediately store the entered value into a variable in memory. This function notifies the control, through a return value, whether it considers the value to be valid or invalid.<P>
Each control can notify the user of error conditions in two forms. A style can be set that causes an audible beep whenever an error is detected. Alternatively, a visual text message can be displayed immediately below the current input control which more fully describes the error. For example, if a user enters a '9' in a Formatted control in a  location where the maximum value has been set to '5', the control would display a message informing the user of the range violation.<P>
InControl Toolbox is available directly from MantaSoft Partners and retails for $179, or $249 with complete source code. Orders will also be taken by GUI Clearing House, which can be reached at 1-800-522-4624. For more information please <I>contact MantaSoft Partners, P.O.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00C7_006D">Programming Library<B></B> <B></B>With Added Memory Capability<A name="00C7_006D"></FONT></h4></P>
Library Technologies announces the addition of EMS/XMS/virtual memory capabilities to their programming library C-Heap for the Microsoft C and Borland C/C++ compilers. The 51 new functions give the programmer low-, medium-, and high-level functions for utilizing EEMS 3.2, LIM 4.0, XMS 2.0, and virtual (disk space) memory, with no 64KB limit on memory block size. The most powerful, high-level functions provide an automatic swapping mechanism (with locking capability) to completely remove the burden of managing EMS/XMS/virtual memory from the programmer, making the use of EMS/XMS/vmem an extremely simple matter. At all function levels, the programmer specifies whether EMS or XMS is to be used preferentially, but the fucntions use whatever is available. If neither is available, or when EMS/XMS is used up, the medium-and high-level functions can use disk space automatically. The user of disk space can be selectively disabled, though, or memory can be allocated specifically from disk space if desired; thus, the programmer can be sure that memory is being utilized exactly as he wishes. All virtual memory I/O occurs through from zero to four disk caches of up to 16KB each in size, which the programmer may specify be allocated to dramatically increase the speed of virtual memory I/O. With the high-level functions, a "dirty bit" can be cleared to avoid  writes to EMS/XMS/virtual memory when the data has not been changed, which can greatly speed execution. All functions are compatible with malloc(), and all memory models but the tiny model are supported.<P>
These functions join the other 500+ assembly-language functions already in C-Heap, which deal with DOS memory management. The cost of C-Heap is $199, or $399 with source code. For further information <I>contact Library Technologies, P.O. Box 56031, Madison, WI 53705-9331, (800) 767-4214</I>.<P>
