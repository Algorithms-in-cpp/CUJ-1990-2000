<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="012A_008C">Lattice Releases PenBase<A name="012A_008C"></FONT></h4></P>
Lattice, Inc. has released PenBase, a database management library for pen-based computer applications. The library allows programmers to create, assess, and update files that are dBASE compatible by using C functions that supplement GRiD's PenRight! Pro Software Development Kit.<P>
The PenBase library includes 85 functions that can be called directly from a C program. PenBase functions were designed with three goals to support pen-based database applications in an MS-DOS environment: they allow programmers to build file management systems which use indexed sequential access method (ISAM), they integrate many of the tasks required to transfer data between the screen and database files, and they create and manage files which are compatible with the dBase III PLUS file structure. Specific functions that integrate the database with the pen application include the ability to link fields, controls and lists directly to the database, and the ability to load fields or controls with values from the database records.<P>
PenBase is $495 and does not require royalties or runtime licenses. <I>Contact Lattice, Inc., 3010 Woodcreek Dr., Suite A, Downers Grove, IL 60515, (708) 769-4060; FAX: (708) 769-4083</I>.<P>
