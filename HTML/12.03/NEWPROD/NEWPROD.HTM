<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00B2_0057">Omega Systems Ships VERSIONS<A name="00B2_0057"></FONT></h4></P>
Omega Systems has begun shipping VERSIONS, a version control system for Windows. VERSIONS provides version control support for programmers by managing multiple project resources including source code, documentation, or other files. VERSION supports varied file formats, including binary files, and doesn't limit the number or types of files which can be maintained. VERSIONS is network-compatible and supports multiple developers working on the same project, allowing storage of both temporary and permanent versions of a file.<P>
Eschewing the approach of storing incremental changes to files, VERSIONS stores previous versions of a file in a "master project," a proprietary format that labels, maintains, and tracks files for access to both the most current, as well as any past version. VERSIONS also tracks changes to a project either on a server or local workstation through the master project. Users check files into and out of the master project as needed and VERSIONS automates the process of determining which files need to be checked in or out. VERSIONS is $99. One copy of VERSIONS is required for each workstation in a networked installation.
