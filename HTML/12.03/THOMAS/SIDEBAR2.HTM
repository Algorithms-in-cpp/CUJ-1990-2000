The kshell source we started with was PD KornShell written by Eric Gisin <I>&lt;egisin@math. UWaterloo. EDU&gt;</I>. PD Korn Shell installs on 4.2+ BSD System V, and POSIX-compatible systems. PD KornShell assumes you have Standard C (ANSI) and POSIX header files functions. The PD KornShell source is available on several Internet locations including:<P>
<pre>ftp.uu.net (192.48.96.9)
/usenet/comp.sources.amiga/volume91/shells</pre>

We assembled the kshell on a HP-UX machine using HP's C++ compiler. On the HP-UX system, which is a hybrid UNIX system (System V &amp; BSD), only a negligible amount of source modification was to get the shell up and running. Since the source was in " public-domain UNIX-type" C, we decided to leave the original parts in C and incorporate our enhancements in a C++ class. To facilitate the intermingling of C and C++, we instructed the C++ compiler to suppress name mangling (See "Using C/C++ with Clipper" by Mark W. Schumann in the December 1993 issue of CUJ for a thorough treatment of name mangling in C++).<P>
