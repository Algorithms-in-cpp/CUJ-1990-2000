<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01EC_00F0">Dyad Software Extends C++ with M++ Quad and M++ Array<A name="01EC_00F0"></FONT></h4></P>
Dyad Software has released two C++ packages, M++ Array, a flexible, multi-dimensional array library, and M++ Quad, a numerical integration package that works with Dyad's M++ Scientific to allow integration of one or two dimensional functions over finite or infinite limits.<P>
M++ Array provides general math operations, indexing or sub-array capabilities, random number generation, trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, exponential and logarithmic operations, generalized array manipulations, statistical operations, fundamental matrix operations such as inner products, general matrix inverse, linear least squares, and equation solution, and more. The operations function over multidimensional arrays with compile and runtime testing of array conformance where required. M++ Array costs $119, and is available for Borland, Microsoft, and Symantec C++ compilers.<P>
M++ Quad uses adaptive Gauss-Konrod quadrature rules to integrate functions that can be continuous, discontinuous, or infinite. The user selects the integration rule, the end-points, the number of points, and the error criteria. M++ Quad requires the use of M++ Scientific. M++ Quad costs $195 for DOS and $245 for UNIX single user systems. <I>Contact Dyad Software Corporation, 515 116th Avenue NE Suite 120, Bellevue, WA 98004, (800) 366-1573; FAX: (206) 637-9428.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01EC_00F1">Lucid Releases New Compilers and Energize Programming System<A name="01EC_00F1"></FONT></h4></P>
Lucid, Inc., announced the Lucid C++ compiler, Lucid C compiler v2.1, and the Energize Programming System, an integrated environment for developing C and C++ code. Energize is a tightly-integrated system combining various familiar UNIX tools with new tools and a central server to provide control and data integration. Lucid C++ is incorporated into Lucid's Energize system. Energize provides incremental compilation and linking at the function and class levels. The central service is maintained using a client/server architecture and an object-oriented database. Energize includes a variety of tools (including graphical browsers) for navigating through code and viewing programs elements and structure from different perspectives.<P>
Lucid C++ is a native code compiler providing direct compilation of C++ (2.1) for Sun SPARC and compatibles. Lucid C++ includes a debugger with C++ extensions and two compilation modes to facilitate the transition from C to C++ or permit work in both languages. Lucid C is an ANSI C- and K&amp;R C-compliant compiler for SPARC-based workstations. Release 2.1 includes ANSI C-compatible versions of more than 300 header files. The new version improves consistency checking and early error detection when using SunOS library functions. Optimizations, such as improved instruction scheduling, loop unrolling, and register renaming for inner loops, were added in release 2.1.<P>
In January 1991, Lucid acquired Peritus International Inc. for their C and C++ compiler technology. These new systems are the result of their joint efforts, released under the Lucid name. Energize is priced at $4,250 for single users with discounts to $2,975 for larger work groups and is available on Sun SPARC and compatible workstations. Lucid C++ is priced at $1,500, while Lucid C is priced at $695. <I>Contact Lucid, Inc., 707 Laurel Street, Menlo Park, CA 94025, (415)329-8400; FAX (415) 329-8480.</I><P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01EC_00F3">Softran Announces C-Debug and C-Verify for VAX/VMS<A name="01EC_00F3"></FONT></h4></P>
Softran Corporation announced today that C-Debug and C-Verify, C testing and debugging tools previously available only for UNIX and DOS, are available for VAX/VMS. C-Debug is a memory debugger which works with any C compiler and is described as excelling at finding pointer problems. C-Verify is a coverage analyzer for testing C programs, which documents every possible conditional branch and, according to Softran "proves that every line of code has been tested." C-Verify's cross-referencing utility displays C source in four windows, automatically highlighting each statement containing untested conditional branches. The programmer can exclude an untested branch of make notes for a new test to execute that branch.<P>
C-Debug and C-Verify work consistently across supported platforms, simplifying multi-platform development and support. Softran provides both toll-free telephone support (in the U.S. and eighteen foreign countries) and a support bulletin board system. The software comes with a sixty-day unconditional return policy and a year of free software support and upgrades.<P>
C-Debug is available for the following operating systems and platforms: MS-DOS, SCO XENIX/UNIX, AT&amp;T 3B2, NCR Tower, Motorola, DEC Ultrix, Sun, Data General, Hewlett-Packard, IBM AIX, and VAX/VMS.
