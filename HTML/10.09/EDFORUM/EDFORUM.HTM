<A name="01EA_0000"><A name="01EA_0000">Changes, changes everywhere. I have lots of news to report this month, and it's all about changes.<P>
First, I must report that this issue contains the last installment of "Doctor C's Pointers." Rex Jaeschke has written this column on a regular basis since the earliest days of <I>The C Users Journal</I>. He has introduced legions of C programmers to many aspects of the language, from the basic to the arcane. He has answered questions with patience and explored issues with practiced courage. I take this opportunity to thank Rex on behalf of both <I>CUJ</I> and the thousands of readers who have benefited from his explanations.<P>
Just a few months ago (Editor's Forum, <I>CUJ</I> June '92) I was thanking Rex Jaeschke for having published <I>The Journal of C Language Translation</I>. He needed a break from that effort and so decided to shut it down voluntarily. Now it seems someone else has agreed to pick up the traces. John Levine in Cambridge, Mass. has arranged with Rex to continue publishing <I>JCLT</I>. With any luck, Levine's first issue will appear soon. So reports of the death of <I>JCLT</I> appear premature.<P>
Next month, we will begin a new column by Chuck Allison. Chuck's "Code Pages" have helped programmers within the Mormon Church get up to speed on C. I liked them so much when I saw them that I wanted to make them available to <I>CUJ</I> readers as well. Chuck is also active in the C++ standardization effort. He has agreed to cover the C++ beat as well as C in coming months. I look forward to his contributions.<P>
Finally, the newest installment on the Great E-mail Debacle. If you paw through back issues of <I>CUJ</I>, you will find that my e-mail address (printed below) changes from time to time. You will also find occasional gripes from e-mail gurus about some of those forms. I have received still other gripes from people who (eventually) got through to me via Internet.<P>
Well, I went and got my domain registered, as <I>plauger.com</I> Presumably this means that critical mail hubs around the world now know how to route mail to me from wherever. I certainly hope that's true. Here's one area where I don't want to report any more changes for the foreseeable future.<P>
