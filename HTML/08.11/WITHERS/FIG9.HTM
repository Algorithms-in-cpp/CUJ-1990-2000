<pre>Anonymous Pipe API

DosMakePipe                 Create an anonymous pipe and
                            returns the handles used to
                            access it.
DosClose                    Close an anonymous pipe handle.
DosRead                     Read from an anonymous pipe
                            (must use "read handle").
DosWrite                    Write to an anonymous pipe
                            (must use "write handle").
DosDupHandle                Useful in assigning a pipe
                            handle to standard input or
                            standard output for child
                            inheritance.
DosSetFHandState            Modify a handles attributes.

Named Pipe API (Server End)

DosMakeNmPipe               Creates an instance of a named
                            pipe and return a handle used to
                            access it.
DosConnectNmPipe            Block waiting for a client
                            process to open a named pipe.
DosDisConnectNmPipe         Disconnect a named pipe from a
                            client process.
DosRead                     Read from named pipe.
DosWrite                    Write to named pipe.
DosClose                    Close a handle to a named pipe.

Named Pipe API (Client End)

DosOpen                     Open a named pipe.
DosWaitNmPipe               Wait for an instance of a named
                            pipe to become available.
DosRead                     Read from a named pipe.
DosWrite                    Write to a named pipe
DosTransactNmPipe           Writes data to a named pipe and
                            then reads a response before
                            returning. Equivalent to
                            DosWrite followed by DosRead.
DosCallNmPipe               Similar to DosTransactNmPipe but
                            the pipe is also opened and then
                            closed.  Equivalent to DosOpen,
                            DosTransactNmPipe, DosClose.

Named Pipe API (Either End)

DosPeekNmPipe               Looks at named pipe data without
                            removing it from the buffer.
DosQNmPHandState            Returns information on the state
                            of a named pipe.
DosSetNmPHandState          Set name pipe state.
DosQNmPipeInfo              Returns additional information
                            about a named pipe.
DosQNmPipeSemState          Returns information about a
                            named pipe associated with a
                            semaphore.
DosSetNmPipeSem             Associates a semaphore with a
                            named pipe.</pre>
