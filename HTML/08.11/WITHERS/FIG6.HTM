<pre>Access to Queue

DosCreateQueue           Creates a queue, assigns queue
                         name, and determines owner process.
DosOpenQueue             Opens an existing queue to allow a
                         client to add records. Returns
                         queue handle and owner PID.
DosCloseQueue            Terminates access to a queue and
                         invalidates client handle. If

                         destroyed.
