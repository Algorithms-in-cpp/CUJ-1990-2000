<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="026C_0160"><A name="026C_0160"><A name="026C_0160">Updates<A name="026C_0160"></FONT></h4></P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="026C_0161">CUG159 Adventure<A name="026C_0161"></FONT></h4></P>
Bob Withers (TX) has updated the adventure game, CUG159 Adventure, which was originally written by Willie Crowther. The code now compiles under Microsoft C v5.10 or later for both MS-DOS and OS/2. The modified code also eliminates the constant disk access during game play.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="026C_0162">CUG266 microPLOX<A name="026C_0162"></FONT></h4></P>
Bob Patton (TX) has updated his original graph/charts drawing program, microPLOX. This v5.0 release includes internal restructuring of the program and several new features: multi-color support for color monitors (CGA, EGA, and VGA), and multiple data file use from one command file. The program was developed under Watcom v7.0.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="026C_0163">CUG292 ASxxxx C Cross Assembers<A name="026C_0163"></FONT></h4></P>
Alan R. Baldwin has released v1.5 of ASxxxx assemblers and linkers. These new releases can now move byte index, direct page mode, and byte PC relative address checking from the assembler to the linker. This change has allowed the following enhancements:<P>
<UL><li>The <I>.setdp</I> directive now has a common format for AS68xx assemblers.</FONT></FONT></li>
<li>Direct page variables may be externally defined with their addresses resolved at link time.</li>
<li>Byte index offsets may be external references and resolved at link time.</li>
<li>Byte PC relative instructions (i.e. branches) may reference external labels or labels in other areas.</li></UL>
The ASxxxx assemblers can generate a listing file that flags the data that will be relocated by the linker. The <I>REL</I> file format now has an additional directive for paging information and has additional flags for <I>page0, page</I>, and <I>unsigned</I> byte formats. The new liker is compatible with the first version of the ASxxxx assemblers.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="026C_0164">CUG297 Small Prolog<A name="026C_0164"></FONT></h4></P>
Henri de Feruady (France) has reported a bug in his "Small Prolog". The bug is located on the line number 134 in file <I>pralloc.c</I>.</FONT></FONT><P>
<pre>Str_mem = os_alloc (heap_size);</pre>
should be replaced with:<P>
<pre>Str_mem = os_alloc (str_size);</pre>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="026C_0166">CUG327 Panels for C<A name="026C_0166"></FONT></h4></P>
Contributed by J. Brown (KS), a shareware package, Panels for C is a collection of user interface routines (windows and menus) for IBM PC. Unlike other window libraries, screen fields and attributes that are defined in an ASCII text file are interpreted at runtime. Thus, fine-tuning user interfaces is possible without recompiling the program. The distribution disk includes a small model object code for Microsoft C, and demo C source and executable code. To obtain the C source code, please contact the author at BC Systems, P.O. Box 781202, Wichita, KS 67278.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="026C_0167">CUG328 WTWG<A name="026C_0167"></FONT></h4></P>
David Blum (CA) has submitted a shareware package, WTWG, with routines for Window Text mode or Window Graphics mode 1.0. WTWG provides drawing boxes, overlapping windows, mouse-selectable buttons, scroll bars, save/restore screens, text/graphics mode operations, transparent integration of mouse and keyboard (the mouse is just another key.), virtual memory system using expanded memory, RAM or disk space, pulldown and popup menus, context-sensitive help, programmer-definable hot keys, keyboard macros (record or playback keystrokes), onscreen clock in either text or graphics mode, simple mouse-driven drawing, screen-saver, data-entry forms, and data validations. The disk includes Turbo C small and large model libraries and Microsoft C medium model library, demo C source and project/batch files, utilities for on-line help, keyboard macros, and file manipulation, and documentation. To obtain the C source code, please contact the author at 1710 Glyndon Ave., Venice, CA 90291.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="026C_0168">CUG329 UNIX Tools for PC<A name="026C_0168"></FONT></h4></P>
This volume contains a collection of submissions. Most of the programs were derived from some UNIX commands and rewritten to compile under MS-DOS or OS/2. The distribution disk includes all the C source code.<P>
Robert Jr. Artigas (TN) has ported UNIX utilites, <I>cat</I> (concatenate files), <I>cut</I> (cut out selected fields of each line of a file), <I>paste</I> (merge same lines of several files or subsequent lines of one file), <I>tr</I> (transliterate characters), <I>wc</I> (word count), <I>vis</I> (visual display of files) and <I>egrep</I> (regular expression matcher search utility) to MS-DOS and OS/2 environments. <I>egrep</I> uses regular expression functions developed by Henry Spencer (Canada).</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><P>
Martin D. Winnick (<I>CA) </I>has modified a cross-referencer<I>, </I>XC by Philip N. Hisley (MD), using Microsoft Quick C. The program is now called <I>XCXREF</I> and processes more symbols from input text.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><P>
Arkin Asaf (Israel) has contributed <I>cflow, define </I>and<I> dprintf. cflow</I> is a program that displays a function dependency tree from input C source files. The program doesn't preprocess and parse the code, but it does a good job of displaying the function dependency tree. It even distinguishes between function definition and function declarations. <I>define</I> constructs C definitions from a plain English description. For example, from a sentence, <I>foo is function returning pointer to array of int., define </I>ouputs<I> int (*foo())[]. dprintf</I> is the implementation of an ANSI standard C function, <I>printf</I>. It is highly portable and expandable.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><P>
Henri de Feraudy (France) has submitted a string substitution utility, csubst. csubst extracts strings or substitutes strings in C source code. The string extraction helps create a substitution table that can be used for substitution. The program was developed with the help of <I>lex</I> (lexical analyzer). Makefiles for Turbo C, Mark Williams C, Zortech C, and QuickC are included as well as the C source files.</FONT></FONT><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="026C_0169">CUG330 CTask<A name="026C_0169"></FONT></h4></P>
CTask, v2.1, contributed by Thomas Wagner (West Germany), is a set of routines that allows your C program to execute functions in parallel, without you having to build in sophiscated polling and switching schemes. CTask handles the switching of processor time with a priority-based, pre-emptive scheduler. It provides a fairly complete set of routines for inter-task communication, event signaling, and task interlocking. CTask also includes a number of drivers for MS-DOS which build on the basic functions that allow you to include serial I/O, printer buffering, and concurrent access to MS-DOS functions into your programs with little programming effort. To compile CTask, Microsoft C v5.1 or later, or Turbo C v2.0 or later are required. Microsoft MASM 5.1 or later, or TASM 1.01 or later is required for the assembly parts. The disk includes well-written documentation, C and assembly source code, library modules for Microsoft C and Turbo C, <I>make</I> files, and sample application source code.</FONT></FONT><P>
