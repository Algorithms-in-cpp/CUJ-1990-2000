<p>NuMega Technologies, Inc. has announced SoftICE 3.2, a debugger for Windows 95/NT.
SoftICE 3.2 enhancements include SMP (Symmetric Multiprocessing) support for
Windows NT and significantly enhanced video support.<p>
SoftICE 3.2 supports the first official beta version of Windows 98, providing
debugging for the new Windows Driver Model (WDM) and Universal Serial Bus (USB)
devices. SoftICE 3.2 for Windows NT supports debugging application-server
software that uses Windows NT SMP capabilities. SoftICE 3.2 is compatible with
Pentium and Pentium Pro multiprocessor systems, with up to eight CPUs that use
the standard Intel multiprocessor scheme. In addition, SoftICE 3.2 displays the
debug screen and the Windows screen at the same time on one display. SoftICE
now is presented in a resizable, moveable window on the Windows desktop.<p>
SoftICE 3.2 for Windows NT costs $669, and SoftICE for Windows 95 costs $569.
The SoftICE Suite (including SoftICE for Windows NT, Windows 95, Windows 3.x,
and DOS) costs $769. Special upgrade and suite-migration pricing is available

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Baltimore Technologies Announces Secure Messaging Toolkit</FONT></H4>

<p>Baltimore Technologies has announced Secure Messaging Toolkit (SMT), a cryptographic
toolkit that allows developers to add security to any messaging application.
SMT offers security based on S/MIME, a standard for Internet email security.
SMT provides developers with advanced tools to add security features for
applications that involve sensitive or monetary-based messaging. Its API offers
high-level functions for confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and
non-repudiation.<p>
Software developers using SMT can add security without prior knowledge of
cryptographic systems or S/MIME protocols. Security features such as digital
signatures, message hashing, and key generation are all handled transparently
by SMT.<p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Communication Horizons Releases NetLib 32-bit Dynamic Encryption Toolkit</FONT></H4>
