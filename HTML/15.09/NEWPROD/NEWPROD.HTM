                    available over an Ethernet network. NetAcquire extends the
                    cross-platform architecture of Java systems by adding
                    hardware input/output capabilities. In conjunction with
                    Netscape 3.0, applets run on 16 possible operating system
                    and computer combinations. Both standalone Java applications
                    and browser-enabled Java applets can connect to NetAcquire
                    hardware to obtain a real-world interface to analog and
                    digital data. </p>
               
               <p> The NetAcquire Java Toolkit costs

               <h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Galapagos Releases Adaptive Object Storage v1.0</FONT></H4>
               
               <p>Galapagos Software, Inc. has begun
                    shipping the first product based on Associative Database
                    Technology (ADB), called Adaptive Object Storage v1.0 for
                    C++. ADB, a new technology for finding, organizing, and
                    storing data, mimics the associative capabilities of the
                    human mind. Galapagos Software developed ADB to address
                    today's information overload problem caused by the
                    simultaneous convergence of multiple technologies.  </p>
               
               <p> ADB Technology is based on three core
                    capabilities. First, it supports collections of values and
                    bi-directional linking between these collections, allowing
                    additions and deletions to these collections at any time.
                    Second, it offers "category-item" and "recency"
                    models that allow information to be organized based on
                    inclusion in a category and on a specified time period.
                    Third, it supports a unique "dynamic hierarchy"
                    navigational model, which allows users to build a hierarchy
                    on demand. Points of the hierarchy are not fixed, but are
                    decided on by the user while performing a search or
                    organizing information. </p>
               
               <p> Adaptive Object Storage v1.0 costs
                    $300. </p>

               <p> Objective Diagram includes over 20
                    classes that work together to give the Visual C++ developer
                    a framework that defines graphical objects in terms of how
                    they appear, what events they handle, and how they relate to

               <p>TracePoint Technology, Inc. has
                    announced Visual Coverage, a Windows-based testing tool that
                    provides code coverage analysis throughout a product's
                    development-test-delivery cycle. With Visual Coverage,
                    developers can view coverage on any portion of their code
                    and generate a report on the percent executed, as well as
                    the specific areas that need further testing. </p>
               
               <p> For each test run, developers can
                    select various types of coverage. Function coverage shows
                    which functions have and have not been executed. Class
                    coverage allows the developer to view coverage by classes
                    and by methods. Code coverage identifies which instructions
                    have and have not been executed. Line coverage maps
                    completed execution to specific lines of source code. Branch
                    coverage shows which logical branches were and were not
                    taken. Multiple condition coverage shows whether each
                    condition was covered with both the true and false values.
                    Call Pair coverage identifies which calls were and were not
                    executed. </p>

                    MATLAB C++ Math Library, a library of over 300 MATLAB
                    mathematical and supporting functions. This new release
                    allows programmers to build standalone,
                    mathematically-intensive C++ applications that rely on
                    MATLAB's industry-standard math and data formats. </p>
               
               <p> The C++ Math Library makes the
                    familiar, intuitive syntax of MATLAB available directly from
                    C++, without the overhead of an interpreted environment. The
                    Library provides this via a C++ object class that supports

               <p>Fourth Dimension Software has released
                    its EasyClient application development platform, which can
                    run as an ActiveX control. EasyClient is Fourth Dimension's
                    multi-user development platform for creating an
                    application's graphical front-end. ActiveX allows users to
                    access their EasyClient generated applications within any
                    Web browser from their desktop, or from any Web access
                    device. </p>
               
               <p> Unlike Java or HTML, EasyClient has
                    the functionality to develop the windows needed for large
                    scale systems. Programmers do not need to know a programming
                    language to build windows and do not need to be
                    communications experts to administer session handling with
                    the mainframe. </p>
