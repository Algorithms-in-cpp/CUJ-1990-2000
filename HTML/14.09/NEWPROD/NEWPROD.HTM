                IPT Releases SNIP for Windows</FONT></H4>
                </FONT>
               
               <p>IPT Corporation has introduced SNIP, a
                    C++ programming tool that allows users to specify their code
                    patterns, describe object model design, and generate C++
                    classes for those design models. SNIP users enter their Data
                    Structure Model and object relationships using the
                    standardized rules for their corporation, group, or team.
                    SNIP can be extended with a company's own code generation 
                    templates to capture entire coding strategies that make
                    sense in a company's application area. Code results will be
                    obtained automatically with SNIP, because patterns are
                    applied to the code creation process. </p>
               </FONT>
               
               <p> SNIP is available for Windows NT,
                    Windows 95, and as a command-line version for UNIX. </p>

                    Implementing the SQA Test Repository on a large
                    client/server database allows users to implement an
                    enterprise-level client/server testing project. Based on the
                    Sybase SQL Anywhere scaleable database, the SQA Test
                    Repository client/server database offers the portability and
                    recovery architecture of SQL. In addition, SQA offers a
                    repository implementation option for single-user or small
                    workgroup implementations, which uses the Microsoft Access

                    release of CAS.CADE v1.3, an object-oriented software
                    application development platform that provides programmers
                    with a series of reusable software components and a set of
                    predefined object libraries. CAS.CADE includes a class
                    browser that allows the developer to go directly into the
                    data dictionary and navigate graphically to retrieve 
                    documentation about the reusable software components. Using
                    cut-and-paste functions, the developer can insert these
                    components where they are needed in the application program.
                    In the CAS.CADE development language, improved memory
                    management reduces the size of code generated to improve

               <p>DataViews Corporation has announced
                    DV-Centro 1.2, a development tool for building Visual
                    Programming Languages (VPLs) under Windows NT. DV-Centro
                    allows programmers to create true VPL systems based on
                    custom symbols, shapes, and objects connected to data. Based
                    on an object-oriented C++ framework, DV-Centro features a
                    suite of graphical tools that allow users to create reusable
                     components for complex VPL applications. Also featured is
                    an Interactive Control Engine that manages events between
                    the user display and the application components. </p>
               </FONT>
               
               <p> DV-Centro 1.2 features a set of
                    coordinated C++ classes optimized for managing the
                    relationships between graphics and data in VPL applications.
                    This framework decreases the amount of code that has to be
                    programmed, tested, and debugged. DV-Centro also includes a
                    set of C++ utilities for memory management, infinite
                    undo/redo, object storage/retrieval, and journaling. </p>
               </FONT>

                    capabilities for object modeling, controlled iterative
                    development, and round-trip engineering. In addition,
                    Rational released a Java-ready extension of the Rational
                    Apex C/C++ environment, enabling software managers to
                    establish and maintain control of their application
                    architecture and providing integration of Java with C and
                    C++ code. Together, the two products offer support for
                    large-scale Java development efforts. </p>

               <p>REQUISITE, Inc. has announced
                    RequisitePro 1.0, a team-based requirements management tool
                    that integrates traceability and the version control
                    product, PVCS Version Manager. The Windows-based tool
                    provides the ability to follow traceability relationships
                    through a structured hierarchy. For example, when a
                    high-level user needs a change, a developer can quickly
                    identify which software elements must be altered. A tester
                    can pinpoint which test protocols must be revised. Managers
                    can better determine the potential costs and difficulties of
                    implementing the changes. In addition, RequisitePro builds a
                    requirements database that is attached and synchronized to
                    the projects specifications and test plans. This repository
                    holds a development team's documents, requirements, and
                    traceability relationships. </p>

               <p> With RequisitePro, individual

                    documents and managed with an integrated database. All
                    information is centralized in one shared repository.
                    Requirements documentation, management, traceability, and
                    reporting are now performed with one tool. </p>

                JBA Introduces JBA Guidelines v3.3</FONT></H4>
                </FONT>
               
               <p>JBA International has introduced JBA
                    Guidelines v3.3, a software development environment for OS/2
                    WARP and OS/2 v2.1, for generating GUI-based client/server
                    applications. Guidelines has incorporated a messaging layer
                    that ensures that all applications built today are
                    object-enabled. Version 3.3 enhances the distributed message
                    layer by providing an interface between standardized object 
                    calls and the code servicing these calls. This code can be a
                    mixture of existing logic and more advanced CORBA-compliant
                    objects. </p> </FONT>
               
               <p> Currently Guidelines is packaged in
                    two versions: Guidelines for Desktop Developers, with prices
                    starting at $595, and Guidelines for Corporate Developers,
                    priced at $7750 per seat. A Base Pack, in essence a
                    Guidelines tester, is free and can be downloaded from
                    CompuServe (GO Guidelines) or the Internet
                    (http://wwwjba.co.uk). </p>

                Art Technology Group Introduces Dynamo 2</FONT></H4>
                </FONT>
               
               <p>Art Technology Group has introduced
                    Dynamo 2, a Java-based, Internet application engine. Dynamo
                    2 enables Web developers to prototype, build, and deploy
                    scaleable, high-volume, and database-driven Web applications
                    requiring dynamic page generation and personalized content.
                    Based on open standards, Dynamo 2 allows Web developers to
                    embed native Java code (not Javascript) into HTML files to 
                    extend functionality on the server side. Java code is
                    compiled on the server to customize everything from the
                    visual characteristics of the page to behaviors of
                    traditional client-side Java applets. </p>
               </FONT>
               
               <p> Pricing for Dynamo 2 is $5,000 per
                    license, and one year of support can be purchased at
                    $750/year per license. Support is available via the Web,
                    where users can get up-to-date technical information,
                    receive technical support, and download new "Gears"
                    and releases. </p> </FONT>
