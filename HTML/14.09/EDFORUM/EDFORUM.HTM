               <p> Okay, folks, it's standards update
                    time again. I'm still jet lagged from several grueling weeks
                    of travel. In late June, I convened the X3J11/WG14 (C)
                    meeting in Amsterdam. Got home for the week of the Fourth,
                    which also included a quick overnight trip to Washington DC.
                    No sooner had I readjusted to Eastern Standard Time but I
                    had to go back to Europe for the X3J16/WG21 meeting (C++) 
                    meeting in Stockholm. At the time this schedule was set up,
                    I didn't think it would affect me. Had I But Known, I would
                    have used my limited powers as WG14 Convener to make it more
                    humane. </p>
               
               <p> In any event, the C meeting went
                    smoothly, as it usually does. About 20 attendees,
                    representing six countries, were present. Most are old
                    friends by now and work smoothly together. The committee
                    looks to be on schedule to have the technical particulars of
                    C9X decided by the end of 1996. A formal standard should
                    still occur in time to make that 9X an honest designation. 
                    </p>
               
               <p> Without going into a lot of detail,
                    I'll simply say that C9X looks to be the Standard C you've
                    come to know and love with a number of features added
                    primarily for numerical programming. That's largely because
                    the Numerical C Extensions Group was for several years the
                    principal clearing house for extensions to Standard C. The C
                    committee is very conservative, turning down essentially all
                     proposals for which there is no existing practice
                    somewhere. The sad thing, to me, is that any hope of adding
                    class extensions to C, a la C++, is probably dead. The
                    principal champion for this ambitious addition, Bob Jervis
                    at Sun Microsystems, is now caught up in the Java frenzy and
                    can no longer attend meetings. </p>
               
               <p> The C++ meeting went fairly smoothly
                    too, at least through Thursday evening when I left. About 50
                    attendees, also representing six countries, were present.
                    The goal of this meeting was to complete the changes in
                    response to the first Committee Draft ballot, and to vote
                    out the draft for a second such ballot. Actually, it was the
                    goal of the previous meeting to do so -- the March meeting 
                    in Santa Cruz couldn't quite handle all the issues in time,
                    however. </p>
               
               <p> As far as I know, the committee
                    didn't actually vote out the draft this time. A few issues
                    remain to be handled. More important, several national
                    bodies wanted time to review the updated draft before
                    sending it up the line to ISO. But the committee did commit
                    to a feature freeze. If they hold to their promise to
                    themselves, then Standard C++ may actually be pretty well 
                    nailed down by now. </p>
               
               <p> Pete Becker and Dan Saks were also at
                    the meeting, so you should be reading more detail in these
                    pages, from various perspectives, in the coming months. Do
                    stay tuned.</p> </FONT>
