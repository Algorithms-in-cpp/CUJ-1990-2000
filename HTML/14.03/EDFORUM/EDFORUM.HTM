               <p>I don't know about you, but I have
                    trouble shifting gears. When I'm working hard, I have
                    trouble taking time off. When I finally take time off, I
                    have trouble getting started again. My problem even extends
                    to the kinds of tasks I undertake. I love to write software
                    and text that sells, but while I'm busy writing it I don't
                    want to think about commercial matters. I don't even want 
                    the phone to ring. Similarly, I can be a manager or a
                    salesman for days on end just don't ask me to write much
                    code or prose in the bargain. It takes me a day or two to
                    switch modes fully.</p>
               
               <p>After running a software company for a
                    decade, I finally decided that the multiplexing involved
                    wasn't worth the wear and tear on my psyche. I know now that
                    I'm a writer/programmer first and a businessman a long way
                    second. Fortunately for me, I had the opportunity to sell
                    the company and shift my working conditions. Not everyone
                    enjoys the same freedom.</p>
               
               <p>My bet is that everyone in our
                    intellectually demanding profession has similar problems.
                    Your time constant may vary, but Ill bet that every reader
                    of this magazine suffers some loss of annual productivity to
                    a drumbeat of ill-timed interruptions. Few of us can afford
                    the luxury of focusing indefinitely on one project at a
                    time, but we all need stretches of uninterrupted 
                    concentration, and some sense of control over the inevitable
                    interrupts. We also need a bit of slack to get caught up on
                    reading, to think an occasional new thought, or just to
                    recharge our psychic batteries.</p>
               
               <p>I spend a certain number of days a
                    year inside assorted companies, and I can always spot
                    quickly the ones with problems meeting deadlines. They pull
                    programmers out of meetings, or provide them with noisy work
                    environments, or jerk them from project to project with
                    little or no recovery time. They begrudge any vacation time
                    throughout the year then force everyone to take it on short 
                    notice at years end. (The worst ones do all of the above,
                    and then some.)</p>
               
               <p>If this sounds like a familiar
                    problem, don't wait for your boss to solve it for you. You
                    are responsible for maximizing your own productivity, and
                    happiness, to whatever extent you can. You can buy a copy or
                    two of deMarco and Listers Peopleware and give them to your
                    management. You can pin this page up outside your cubicle.
                    But don't get your hopes up too high that the hint will sink
                     home. And remember, even those of us who are self employed
                    face the same struggle on different turf.</p>
