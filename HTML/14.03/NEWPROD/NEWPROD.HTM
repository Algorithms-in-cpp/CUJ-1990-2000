               <p>SYWARE, Inc. has released DataSync 3,
                    the latest version of its database synchronization and
                    replication development toolkit. DataSync provides
                    ODBC-compliant tools to extract, replicate, and synchronize
                    data between centralized and remote databases. The product
                    assists in development of client/server applications with
                    distributed data requirements, such as sales force
                    automation systems, in both LAN-based and mobile computing
                    environments.</p> </FONT>
               
               <p>Using DataSyncs graphical environment,
                    developers define user-specific data subsets from server
                    databases for remote distribution, and also select
                    synchronization rules to control reintegration of new or
                    changed data from remote users. Using simple check and list
                    option boxes, data subsets are defined based on columns and
                    row definitions. Synchronization rules can be customized or 
                    selected from predefined options, depending upon the
                    application requirements.</p>

               <p>The CMX-RTX Real-Time Multi-Tasking
                    Operating System (RTOS) is now available for the Intel
                    8XC251SB Microcontroller and the Philips 80C51-XA
                    Microcontroller. CMX-RTX provides more than 60 kernel
                    services within a single API. The RTOS allows the user to
                    control tasks, events, messages, resources, cyclic timers,
                    queues, fixed-memory blocks, and UARTs. CMX-RTX provides
                    automatic low-power mode when all tasks are waiting or
                    sleeping. Interrupts are also allowed to use some of the CMX
                    functions. The scheduler is based on true preemption.
                    CMX-RTX provides very fast context switch times and very low
                    interrupt latency times. CMX-RTX requires very little ROM
                    and RAM. Several compiler vendors are also supported. Source
                    code and the CMXBug Debugger are included with both
                    packages. There are no royalties. Pricing begins at $995.</p>

               <p>Prentice Hall PTR has released C &amp;
                    C++ Multimedia Cyber Classroom, an interactive multimedia
                    CD-ROM-based C and C++ tutorial, by Dr. Harvey M. Deitel and
                    Paul J. Deitel. C &amp; C++ Multimedia Cyber Classroom lets
                    users learn C and C++ at their own pace.</p>
               </FONT>
               
               <p>Prentice Hall claims users will find
                    coverage of every important C and C++ concept, based on the
                    Deitels college textbooks, C How to Program (Prentice Hall)
                    and C++ How to Program (Prentice Hall), and their corporate
                    training classes.</p> </FONT>
               
               <p>The Deitels begin by teaching the
                    basics of C. Then they teach users how C establishes the
                    groundwork for C++ and how C++ extends C to make a richer,
                    more reliable programming environment. Step-by-step, users
                    will learn the new ideas of object-oriented programming
                    including classes, data abstraction, encapsulation,
                    information hiding, overloading, inheritance, and
                    polymorphism. By the end of the CD, users will be
                    comfortable with advanced C++ concepts such as templates,
                    exception handling, multiple inheritance, and
                    object-oriented file processing.</p>

               <p>JBA is offering OS/2 application
                    developers a 21-day free evaluation of JBA Guidelines, the
                    companys client/server development environment. Targeted at
                    development teams who currently program in COBOL, Basic,
                    RPG, C, and C++, as well as the visual programming
                    environment, Guidelines allows developers to create programs
                    that run on both the PC and server platform. Within 
                    Guidelines, developers are free to code either directly in
                    C++ or in JOT, a high-level object language. JOT allows the
                    coding of event-driven applications that use both the
                    flexibility and graphical nature of personal computers while
                    providing direct access to server technologies. Regardless
                    of the client platform selected, Guidelines will generate
                    portable and flexible C++ for subsequent compilation on the
                    designated target environment.</p>

               <p>Reliance Corporation, has released
                    Comment++ vl.0 for Windows. Comment++, an add-on tool,
                    automatically inserts comments into source code, and assists
                    in maintaining comments.</p>
               </FONT>
               
               <p>Comment++ simplifies the task of
                    commenting source code by recreating comment blocks for
                    every single function, procedure, or method in a source code
                    file. Comment++ accomplishes this by using comment templates
                    stored in scripts that can be invoked and inserted directly
                    into the source code file with one simple keystroke.</p>
               </FONT>
               
               <p>The Comment++ script language provides
                    the ability to layout and create interactive comments
                    capable of prompting for information prior to insertion into
                    the source code file.</p>
