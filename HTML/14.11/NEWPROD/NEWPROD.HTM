                Willows Releases Willows Toolkit 2.0</FONT></H4>
               
               <p>Willows Software, Inc. has released
                    the 32-bit version of the Willows Toolkit, with support for
                    Borland International's ObjectWindows Library (OWL),
                    designed to create a seamless migration path from Windows
                    applications to other platforms. The library is based on a
                    single set of source code that can be compiled and linked
                    for the target environment, allowing developers to deliver 
                    cross-platform, full-featured applications that run at
                    native execution speed. Because the application code remains
                    compatible with Windows, developers can exploit non-Windows
                    platforms with their Windows applications. Unique features
                    let developers combine source code and existing Intel binary
                    objects (i.e., DLLs) to take advantage of third-party
                    component technology without requiring vendor source code.
                    The Willows Toolkit has no ties to Windows source code and
                    no run time royalties. </p>
               
               <p> The Willows Toolkit now offers OWL
                    encapsulations of the Windows 95 common controls such as Tab
                    Controls, Property Pages, and Tool Tips, as well as
                    encapsulations of splitter windows, splash screens, dockable
                    toolbars, print preview, and animation. Additionally, the
                    Willows Toolkit supports synchronization objects for
                    multi-threaded development. </p>
               
               <p> Pricing for all supported UNIX
                    platforms (Sun Solaris, SunOS, IBM AIX, HP-UX, Digital UNIX,
                    SGI IRIX, SCO UNIX, UnixWare, and Linux) is $4,995 per
                    developer. A Linux version with no source code is also
                    available for $1,250 per developer. Pricing for the
                    Macintosh is $495 per developer. Educational discounts are
                    available. </p>

                WGS Releases Flagship 4.4 and Linux Pro 4.0 </FONT></H4>
               
               <p>WorkGroup Solutions (WGS) has released
                    FlagShip 4.4, a next generation programming language, and
                    Linux Pro 4.0, a PC-based Linux. </p>
               
               <p> FlagShip supports multiple
                    simultaneous users attached to a single PC and hundreds on
                    higher-end systems. It allows either early or late binding
                    of individual objects, has object orientation, and general
                    syntax similar to C++. Flagship 4.4 features include more
                    than 160 standard functions, commands, and OOP methods, and
                    support of heterogeneous networks (via NFS or Internet). 
                    </p>
               
               <p> Linux Pro 4.0 includes features such
                    as the following: all components are pre-configured to run
                    once installed, without the hours of tinkering normally
                    associated with new operating systems; it installs direct
                    from CD on most systems without the need for boot floppies;
                    PCMCIA support is available for notebooks; and it includes
                    the new kernel version 2.0. </p>
               
               <p> An evaluation copy of FlagShip 4.4 is
                    available on disk for $25.00. It may also be downloaded from
                    the web site shown below. Linux Pro 4.0 is available as a

               <p>Premia Corporation has announced the
                    release of Codewright Professional Programmer's Editor
                    v4.0d. The new version includes an integration module for
                    Borland's Delphi 2.0. Premia also offers newly registered
                    users of Codewright six months of free maintenance, and a
                    new toll-free number to call for technical support. </p>
               
               <p> The integration module for Borland's
                    Delphi 2.0 allows users to edit code with either of two
                    editors simultaneously: the editor built into Delphi, or the
                    Codewright editor. The module mirrors edits from one editor
                    into the other editor, avoiding potential data loss, and
                    eliminating the need to load, save, and reload files when
                    switching editors. Even noncurrent, non-project files are 
                    protected in this manner. </p>
               
               <p> Other recent additions to Codewright
                    include support for VC++ 4.1 browser files, an HTML viewer,
                    and JAVA support. The vi keymap has also been enhanced in
                    this release. </p>
               
               <p> Upgrades to Codewright v4.0d from
                    V3.1 and previous versions may be obtained for $79. </p>

               <p>IONA Technologies has released
                    OrbixTalk, its first implementation of the CORBA Events
                    Services. OrbixTalk is a scalable messaging system that
                    implements an events paradigm, which enables reliable
                    decoupled messaging between objects and applications in a
                    distributed system. </p>
               
               <p> OrbixTalk works seamlessly with
                    IONA's Orbix object request broker as well as with other
                    CORBA services provided by IONA Technologies. Scalability is
                    ensured by the asynchronous nature of the OrbixTalk
                    architecture and the underlying UDP/IP (User Datagram
                    Protocol/Internet Protocol) multicast protocol. </p>
               
               <p> In addition to the core OrbixTalk
                    product, a MessageStore component provides persistence,
                    ensuring messages are delivered in the event of client or
                    server failure. MessageStore uses traditional
                    store-and-forward mode, a store-only mode, and on-demand
                    playback. </p>
               
               <p> OrbixTalk costs $1,500 per developer
                    seat on UNIX, $750 on Windows NT. MessageStore pricing is
                    available on request. </p>

                Walnut Creek Releases FreeBSD v2.1 </FONT></H4>
               
               <p>The FreeBSD Project, in association
                    with Walnut Creek CDROM, has released FreeBSD version 2.1, a
                    full 4.4 BSD Lite-based UNIX-like operating system for the
                    PC. FreeBSD comes with a full development environment with
                    C, C++, and FORTRAN compilers and debuggers as standard.
                    Full source code provided for the entire operating system
                    and all utilities make a truly open system. FreeBSD installs
                     easily alongside other operating systems such as DOS and
                    Windows (3.1, 95, or NT) and can share files directly with
                    DOS, both on the local disk and over the network with SAMBA
                    and PCNFS. </p>
               
               <p> The largest change to the FreeBSD
                    operating system since the last release, 2.0, is a revamped
                    VM system with a merged VNVfile buffer cache that increases
                    performance and reduces FreeBSD's memory footprint, making a
                    5MB configuration a more acceptable minimum. Other
                    enhancements include full NIS client and server support,
                    transaction TCP support, dial-on-demand PPP, an improved 
                    SCSI subsystem, early ISDN support, support for FDDI and
                    Fast Ethernet (100Mbit) adapters, and improved support for
                    the Adaptec 2940 (WIDE and narrow) and 3940 SCSI adaptors,
                    and many hundreds of bug fixes. </p>
               
               <p> FreeBSD is available free of charge
                    on the Internet at ftp.freebsd.org and in a convenient
                    CD-ROM distribution from Walnut Creek CDROM for $39.95.
                    Walnut Creek CDROM's 1200-user Internet site at
                    ftp.cdrom.com uses a server running FreeBSD 2.1. </p>

               <p>Nombas Inc. announced
                    ScriptEase:WebServer Edition, a CGI scripting tool with an
                    integrated development environment (IDE) and remote
                    debugger. Based on the company's Cmm language,
                    ScriptEase:WebServer Edition implements the Cmm scripting
                    language into a CGI (Common Gateway Interface) language.
                    ScriptEase:WebServer Edition also protects against
                    hard-to-locate stack crashes and memory overwrite bugs. One
                    of the strongest features of ScriptEase:WebServer Edition is
                    that all server environment variables are available as Cmm
                    variables. Cmm scripts can directly manipulate these
                    variables and convert them to the appropriate Cmm type. For
                    systems that do not support environment variables,
                    ScriptEase:WebServer Edition will extract information from 
                    the appropriate source and create temporary variables that
                    look like environment variables. </p>
               
               <p> Pricing begins at $295 per unit and
                    is based on the operating system. ScriptEase:WebServer
                    Edition is available on Windows, Windows 95, Windows NT,
                    UNIX, Solaris, SunOS, OS/2, MacOS, and Linux platforms. To
                    download a trial version of ScriptEase:WebServer Edition,
                    visit the Nombas Web site at http://www.nombas.com and go to

                MicroHelp Ships VBViewer 2.0 </FONT></H4>
               
               <p>MicroHelp, Inc. has released VBViewer
                    2.0, a new version of its comprehensive file viewer control
                    for visual applications. Offering support for over 30 of the
                    most popular file formats, use of VBViewer enables file
                    viewing capabilities to be built into visual applications --
                    without using the native application that created them. New
                    features include 32-bit ActiveX controls and DLLs, in 
                    addition to the 16-bit VBXs and DLLs. </p>
               
               <p> VBViewer features include: the
                    ability to drag and drop files onto the VBViewer control
                    from drag and drop servers (e.g. Explorer); support for
                    updated versions of popular spreadsheet and word processor
                    applications, including Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, and
                    WordPerfect; printouts of all file formats and file
                    information (such as name and size); automatic detection of 
                    file format regardless of extension; and quick searches
                    through files for text, either by using VBViewer's search
                    dialog or by programmatically specifying the search
                    criteria. </p>
               
               <p> VBViewer 2.0 is compatible with all
                    versions of Microsoft Visual Basic, Visual C++, and any
                    other language that supports VBXs, 16- or 32-bit DLL calls,
                    or 32-bit ActiveX controls (formerly OLE controls). VBViewer
                    2.O costs $149. Registered users of previous versions of
                    VBViewer can upgrade for $89.00. </p>

               <p>Sax Software is now shipping the
                    latest version of its VBA macro language, Sax Basic Engine
                    Pro. Version 3.0 brings the Basic Engine's feature set up to
                    that of the current version of Microsoft's Visual Basic for
                    Applications, and then goes further by adding features that
                    VBA doesn't offer, including full support for events,
                    classes, and multiple modules. Because it's an ActiveX 
                    control, Sax Basic Engine Pro can be integrated into Visual
                    Basic, Visual C++, and Delphi applications. </p>
               
               <p> Sax Basic Engine Pro offers full VBA

               <p> R-Active's BetterState PRO Version
                    4.0, a PC-based design tool for statecharts, now generates
                    C++ code that supports true preemptive multithreading for
                    Windows 95 and Windows NT applications. Earlier versions of
                    BetterState realized concurrency using a single thread of
                    computation in which a compile-time, non-preemptive schedule
                    of state transitions was used to implement concurrecy. 
                    However, many real-time and user interface applications
                    require true preemptive multithreading capabilities. With
                    the new code generator, the underlying Windows 95 or Windows
