               <p> I just learned via e-mail that some
                    folks want to begin developing an ISO standard for Java. The
                    decision to do so, or not, will have been made by the time
                    you read this. For my part, I know better than to volunteer
                    for yet another standards effort. (See last month's Editor's
                    Forum, for example.) But I'm sure lots of other people will
                    happily pitch in to do the job. </p>
               
               <p> Whether the job should be done now is
                    another matter. Seems to me that Sun has been doing a pretty
                    respectable job of keeping the language stable enough for
                    third-parties to match, yet flexible enough to adapt as
                    people find out what Java is really good for. I have a few
                    ideas along those lines myself, and I hate to see premature
                    standardization interfere with the field debugging of a 
                    decent language spec. There's still a real place in the
                    world for de facto industry standards, I think. </p>
               
               <p> On that subject, I got to make an
                    interesting announcement at the Embedded Systems Conference
                    in San Jose last September. (Our sister publication,
                    Embedded Systems Programming, is a major driving force
                    behind this twice yearly event.) A consortium of several
                    large Japanese companies has developed a subset of C++ for
                    writing embedded applications. The Embedded C++ Technical 
                    Committee, as they call themselves, is making this spec
                    freely available to interested parties in the hopes of
                    minimizing the proliferation of subsets as people apply C++
                    to applications with tight time and memory constraints.
                    </p>
               
               <p> My interest in Embedded C++, as some
                    of you might guess, is in supplying the library to be
                    shipped with compilers from various vendors. With the likes
                    of Fujitsu, Hitachi, NEC, and Toshiba behind this effort, I
                    figure it bids fair to become a widely used dialect all
                    around the world, not just in Japan. I also suspect it will
                    prove of interest to more than just programmers of embedded 
                    systems. </p>
               
               <p> I can only hope that we all get to
                    fine tune the language and library for a year or so before
                    some ambitious souls decide it's time to nail everything
                    down in an international standard. But with Java under the
                    microscope already, who knows. </p>

               <p> P.S. Bobby Schmidt celebrates his
                    first anniversary as a columnist in an interesting way this
                    month -- he's not here. He just plain got too busy doing all
                    those other things that make him knowledgable enough to
                    write a good column. He'll be back next month. </p></BLOCKQUOTE>
