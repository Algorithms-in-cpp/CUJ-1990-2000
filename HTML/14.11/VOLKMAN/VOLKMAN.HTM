               <p>Overall, I've found the greatly
                    renowned search engines of the WWW to be hostile to
                    straightforward queries about C++ library source code. This
                    month, I'd like to take a brief detour on the information
                    highway to see how well these search engines stack up to a
                    typical query: "C++ library source code"
                    (including quote marks). Along the way, I'll list some of
                    the best findings. One interesting result is that any one
                    search engine almost never returned any of the same
                    documents found by the others (of the first 20 hits
                    examined).</p>

               <p>AltaVista (http://www.altavista.digital.com) destroys anything remotely resembling
                    punctuation so it transformed my query to "C library
                    source code" and produced a total of 14 hits. After
                    removing the quotes, AltaVista claimed about 1,000,000 hits,
                    but it also decided that "C" was just a noise
                    word. Accordingly, it equally weighted library source code
                    in Pascal, Assembly language, Oberon, FORTRAN, and others
                    with C or C++. From the first query, I found several useful
                    links, including:</p>

               <p>The Debug Malloc Library (dmalloc)
                    library has been designed as a drop-in replacement for the
                    system's malloc, realloc, calloc, free, and other memory
                    management routines while providing powerful debugging
                    facilities configurable at run time. These facilities
                    include such things as memory-leak tracking, fencepost write
                    detection, file/line number reporting, and general logging 
                    of statistics.<BR>
                     The library is highy portable and claims usability on least
                    the following operating systems: AIX, BSDI, DG/UX, HPUX,
                    Irix, Linux, MS-DOS, OSF, Solaris, SunOS, and Ultrix. The
                    package includes the library, configuration scripts, debug
                    utility application, test program, and extensive
                    documentation (formats: text, texi, info, and ps). There is
                    also online documentation. dmalloc is distributed as
                    shareware and requires a $35 fee for use beyond the
                    evaluation period.</p>

                    to "C" and then decided that "C" by
                    itself was insignificant and dropped it from the query. It
                    then combined "source," "code," "codes,"
                    and "library" to come up with a list of 300,000
                    pages containing these four keys. Among the top 20 hits were

                    Collection" page. The collection includes dozens of
                    Genetic Algorithm (GA) implementation libraries, most with
                    C/C++ source, that you can download with a click of your
                    mouse. For example, libga100.tar.Z is a C library which is
                    both easy to use and has "many knobs to turn." It
                    supports both generational and steady-state models with many
                    standard operators (via function pointers). libga100.tar.Z

                    the top ranking page having an 89% confidence level. Excite
                    also gave me the option to sort by site, which I found
                    intriguing but not useful. Excite seems to give the highest
                    weight to the shortest page fulfilling the query. Excite did
                    not report query modification, though I suspect it may have 
                    silently dropped the string "C++," since fewer
                    than 30% of the hits were related to C++. Among the top 20

                    maintained by Andre Merwe &lt;andrev@aztec.co.za&gt; seems
                    to be a very professionally polished site but which had only
                    attracted a few hundred hits when I contacted it. Its
                    purpose is an online registry of URL links to source code on
                    the Internet. At this point it doesn't have its own internal
                    search engine but rather is broken into useful categories
                    such as General Programming, C++ OWL/MFC, Delphi, Java, and
                    so on. The Zen Source Library is definitely an Internet
                    resource that's long overdue.</p>
               
               <p>There must have been a problem
                    communicating with Excite using my Netscape Gold version
                    2.01 browser since clicking on the "Next Documents"
                    button yielded the cryptic "Error: no query terms were
                    found in index." This left me particularly unexcited.</p>

                    modified my query and eliminated the string "C++"
                    for unspecified reasons. Nevertheless, it returned 199,000
                    hits, strikingly close to the figures reported by the Excite
                    engine. Furthermore, it also claimed 6 more hits on pages
                    that were "rated and reviewed." Unfortunately, the
                    truncation of my query string caused online public library
                    card-catalogs to dominate the top 20 returned hits. Among

                    a Magellan 1-Star ("*") rating probably due to its
                    lack of flashy graphics. In my opinion, it is very useful
                    and deserves at least a 3-star ("***") rating.
                    Specifically, this page allows you to design digital filters
                    and generate C or C++ code by the bilinear transform or
                    matched z-transform method. All you need to do is enter the
                    relevant parameters for a Butterworth, Chebyshev, Bessel, or
                    Resonator model and hit the "Submit" button. In
                    addition to source code, you also receive dynamically
                    generated graphs showing "Magnitude and Phase vs.
                    Frequency" (see <A href="volkf1.htm">Figure 1</a>)

                    and "Impulse Response" so you can understand the

                    Furthermore, InfoSeek is the only search engine that clearly
                    retained the keyword "C++," and weighted it in the
                    results: 18 of the top 20 hits were definitely C++ libraries

                    is a C++ class library for dealing with full-depth grayscale

                    original posting in comp.sources.misc. Grayimage supports
                    all standard image algebra/arithmetics including dealing
                    with image slices, histogram equalization, and computing
                    various norms. The package reads and writes PGM, XWD, and
                    Group G (grayscale) TIFF file formats with automatic
                    recognition of the input image file format. It's possible to

               <p>InfoSeek remains ahead of the other
                    search engines in its ability to recognize and preserve
                    keywords and indices that contain punctuation. In a world of
                    punctuated acronymns like "C++," "OS/2,"
                    "v.34," and "8859-1," the web search
                    engines must change their methods or risk losing information
                    forever. The art of indexing and retrieving from the World
                    Wide Web remains in the realm of black magic and I think it
                    will be some years before you can choose a single search
                    engine and believe that it's going to do the job for you
                    every time. Ironically, at least one of the five engines
                    surveyed will almost certainly have modified its searching
                    heuristics by the time this story goes to press. Such is the
                    instantaneous and volatile (some might say fickle) nature of
                    information on the web. In subsequent months, I'll be
                    reviewing more search engine sites so you can help yourself
                    to the best of the Web. My motto is simple: "If at
                    first you don't succeed, try, try another search engine."</p>

                    standard. The kit contains the sources for the library
                    (libpthreads.a) and a complete set of man pages for all
                    POSIX 1003.1c functions. Both PCthreads and a DCE
                    implementation of threads for Linux can be downloaded here.</p>
