<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00AB_003F">Micro-Processor Services Releases MASM to C Translator<A name="00AB_003F"></FONT></h4></P>
Micro-Processor Services, Inc., has released MASM2C, a tool designed to translate MASM code generated by a disassembler into C source code. Working with a disassembler, MASM2C can be used to translate from an .EXE file to intelligible C source. MASM2C contains a syntax analyzer, a MASM-to-tertiary converter, and a tertiary-to-C converter. The tertiary language is used to maintain logical equivalence between source and target languages, and is used in the entire Micro-Processor Services family of translators. MASM2C is compatible with V Communications' Sourcer and other disassemblers, and is error message compatible with "Brief" (or other editors supporting Microsoft C) permitting translation within an editor environment. MASM2C supports 8086, 80186, 80286, 80286P, 80386, and 80386P instructions. The translation includes MASM error bypass and C beautifier.<P>
MASM2C is available in both a standard version ($475) and a protected-mode version ($850). The standard version can handle files of 2000 to 3000 lines, while the protected-mode version can handle up to 40,000 lines at 16MB. Translation speed is 400 to 500 lines per minute.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00AB_0040">Compass Point Software Introduces application::ctor<A name="00AB_0040"></FONT></h4></P>
Compass Point Software, Inc., has announced their application::ctor (pronounced "application constructor") product, a GUI application-development tool for Microsoft Windows. application::ctor includes an object-oriented "view Editor", a user-interface class library containing over 100 classes, and a C++ class browser. Application::ctor can be used to build Multiple Document Interface (MDI) windows and provide attachment and gravity allowing automatic rearranging and resizing of controls when the window is resized. application::ctor can also subdivide a window into regions called "hot areas." Protoypers can use the View Editor to construct an application's user-interface and to attach pre-defined prototyping functions from the class library. Once the prototype's functionality and appearance are established, developers can attach C++ code to the events in the View Editor to build a deliverable application.<P>
application::ctor requires Windows 3.1 and a C++ compiler. The price is $99. <I>Contact Compass Point Software, 332A Hungerford Drive, Rockvill, MD 20850, (301) 738-9109</I>.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00AB_0041">Intel's Tunes C Compiler for Superscalar Microprocessor<A name="00AB_0041"></FONT></h4></P>
Intel Corporation has introduced CTOOLS960 Release 4.0, a C compiler which exploits the superscalar architectures of their i960R CA and i960 CF microprocessors. Intel's announcement claimed improvements of up to 40% in application program performance. The CTOOLS960 compiler collects information about an application program during execution of the program to drive its optimization. The CTOOLS960 compiler was designed to bring optimization to both superscalar and non-superscalar, and can optimize programs written for any i960 microprocessor, including the original Kx and the Sx series.<P>
The CTOOLS960 package includes the compiler, the assembler, and utilities designed for appliciation development and performance optimization on the i960 microprocessor family. CTOOLS960 Release 4.0 is priced at $2000 for MS-DOS hosts, $3500 for HP9000 hosts, and $4300 for SUN4 or IBM RS6000.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00AB_0042">Microtech Research Supports Cross Development for Intel processors on IBM RS/6000<A name="00AB_0042"></FONT></h4></P>
Microtec Research, Inc., has announced it's Intel i960 and 8086-family microprocessor development tools for the IBM RISC System/6000. These tools complement the Motorola 68000-family tools already provided by Microtec Research, and were ported under an agreement with IBM. On the RS/6000, the cross development tools include an ANSI C cross compiler, a Macro Cross Assembler, and the XRAY Debugger. A C++ cross compiler is available for 68000 targets. The XRAY Debugger debugs optimized C code, allowing engineers to work with production-quality code. The XRAY Debugger provides an X Window System Motif interface. The XRAY Debugger on the RS/6000 supports instruction set simulation and debug monitor as execution environments. With instruction set simulation, software development can begin before the target hardware is available, while with monitor-based debugging, developers can perform real-time debugging while software runs on the target hardware. Microtec Research C compilers comply with ANSI C, but also support K&amp;R C. The C++ compilers comply with version 2.1 of the AT&amp;T specification.<P>

Microware Systems Corporation has announced their Ultra C compiler, an ANSI C compatible compiler with an architecture and optimizing algorithms designed to maximize performance in real-time applications. Ultra C has been tested for compliance with the Plum Hall C Validation Suite. Ultra C is closely tied to Microware's OS-9 and OS-9000 real-time operating systems, including I/O and system calls. The Ultra C compiler is compatible with any processor running a Microware operating system. With Ultra C, Microware provides a tightly-coupled compiler and operating system, and a single source of technical support.<P>
The Ultra C architecture divides compilation into four processes: a front-end language process, an optimization and linking function, a target processor back end, and the assembly and linking function. Ultra C makes extensive use of an intermediate code (I-Code), performing linking and optimization on the I-Code, in addition to the other three stages of compilation. The language processor is compatible with source for previous Microware compilers, ANSI C source, and ANSI-extendable code. Ultra C can generate object code for any of its target processors, facilitating application development for multiple target systems.<P>
