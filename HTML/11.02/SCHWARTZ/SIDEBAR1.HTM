In these tests, a small program, which adds the same random numbers to each of two binary trees, optimizes each copy of the tree 30 times. (Since the tree is initially flattened and then rebuilt, rebuilding a balanced tree should take just as long as rebuilding a degenerate one.) Thirty repetitions was deemed to be sufficient to cancel any round-off or timer errors. <A href="tab1.htm">Table 1</a>
gives the time needed for each routine to complete its optimizations. <A href="fig3.htm">Figure 3</a>
is a graphical representation of the data in the table.<P>
