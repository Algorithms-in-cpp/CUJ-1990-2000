You can find copies of STL at various places on the Internet. The horse's mouth, as it were, is Hewlett-Packard's anonymous ftp site, butler.hpl.hp.com. The Free Software Foundation, naturally enough, happily includes STL in libstd++, the library they are building to accompany GNU C++. Try their anonymous ftp site prep.ai.mit.edu, among others.<P>
A very informative web site is maintained by David R. Musser at Rensslaer Polytechnic Institute. Reproduced below is Musser's original announcement from last year. The description is still fairly current, last time I looked.<P>
P.J. Plauger<P>
"Extensive information on STL (The ANSI/ISO C++ Standard Template Library) is now available on the World Wide Web. Included is a very detailed hypermedia reference manual for all STL generic algorithms. Brief overviews of containers and other kinds of STL components are also given. The ANSI/ISO specification document for STL and some related research material are also accessible.<P>
The URL is: http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~musser/stl.html<P>
The information is best viewed with the Mosaic browser, although much of it can also be viewed with the character-oriented Lynx viewer. For those who have Mosaic on their systems but are not familiar with its use, detailed instructions are attached below.<P>
This material is still being evolved. More example programs that use STL will be added, and in the generic algorithms reference we plan to add the ability for users to provide their own input for the example programs that are executable from each algorithm data sheet. (Some material, about local compilers and directories, is mainly of interest to the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute community.)<P>
Please send comments and suggestions for improvement to musser@cs.rpi.edu.<P>
Detailed instructions:<P>
<UL><li>start mosaic:</li><br>
mosaic (or maybe xmosaic)
<li>open the URL (Universal Resource Locator) of the STL home page: click on File/Open URL, and type:</li><br>
http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~musser/stl.html
<li>click on the blue text entries, they are hypertext links.</li>
<li>click on Back (at the bottom of the Mosaic viewer) anytime you want to return to the page you just left.</li>
<li>to make it easier to get to this location next time you run Mosaic, add the STL URL to your Hotlist: get back to the STL home page and click on Navigate/Add-to-Hotlist. Then anytime you want to get to it, click on Navigate/Hotlist and select 'The Standard Template Library.'</li></UL>
