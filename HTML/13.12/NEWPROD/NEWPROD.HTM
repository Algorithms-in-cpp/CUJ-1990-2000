<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01E9_0117">Nu-Mega Announces Soft-ICE for Windows 95<A name="01E9_0117"></FONT></h4></P>
Nu-Mega Technologies, Inc. has announced the availability of Soft-ICE for Windows 95, a system-aware debugging tool. Unlike other debuggers, Soft-ICE loads before Windows 95 and allows debugging even through the Windows 95 initialization code. Soft-ICE for Windows 95 supports address contexts and threads, and allows the developer to set breakpoints on Windows messages, I/O ports, interrupts, and memory accesses.<P>
The memory range breakpoint feature allows developers to capture a program's execution history in a trace buffer while the program is executing.<P>
Soft-ICE can also debug through interrupt service routines, drivers, and virtual device drivers (VxDs) at the source code level. Soft-ICE for Windows 95 is available for $399. Upgrades for existing customers are available, as are corporate site license options.<P>
For more information contact Nu-Mega Technologies, Inc., P.O. Box 7780, Nashua, NH 03060-7780. +1-603-889-2386. FAX: +1-603-889-1135. e-mail: info@numega.com. WWW: http://www.numega.com/.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01E9_0118">Stingray Software Announces VC++/MFC Class Libs<A name="01E9_0118"></FONT></h4></P>
Stingray Software, Inc. has released two new Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) extension class libraries, MFC++ 1.0 (Mantaray Foundation Classes++) and Objective Grid 1.0. Both products provide a variety of MFC-based C++ classes that Microsoft Visual C++ programmers can use in developing Windows 95 applications.<P>
MFC++ 1.0 is a set of general-purpose MFC extension classes that fall into a range of categories including document/view enhancements; image classes for reading, writing, and manipulating popular image formats; Win32 classes; MDI alternative classes; and MFC-based control classes.<P>
Objective Grid provides a grid control that supports a variety of cell types and can be used in many different contexts. For example, Objective Grid can be used as a child window, as a pop-up window, and in a dialog.<P>
Objective Grid provides ODBC support via a set of CRecordSet derivatives. The developer can attach Objective Grid to any data source by overriding one C++ virtual function. Also, Objective Grid supports printing, print preview, find/replace and cut/copy/paste and completely integrates these operations with existing MFC classes.<P>
The introductory price for MFC++ is $495 and the introductory price for Objective Grid is $395. The two products are being offered as a bundle for the introductory price of $795. Both products include full source code at no additional cost. All current versions of Microsoft Visual C++ (l.5x, 2.x) are supported including 16-bit and 32-bit releases.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01E9_0119">MKS Announces MKS Code Integrity<A name="01E9_0119"></FONT></h4></P>
Mortice Kern Systems Inc. has released MKS Code Integrity Version 1.1, a C source code analysis tool for UNIX platforms, consisting of a code analysis engine, an extensible API database, and graphical user interface. Developers can use the tool interactively to identify and reduce unexpected system and IT architecture dependencies, develop a Software Development Kit (SDK) approach to their IT architecture, access API and standards information, and create portable and maintainable code. Development managers can use Code Integrity to follow established coding policy, manage complex code development, assess ports to new platforms, and reduce porting and maintenance costs.<P>
For organizations seeking to develop standards-conforming software solutions, MKS Code Integrity also integrates such internationally accepted standards as ANSI C, POSIX.1, POSIX.2, XPG3, XPG4, Single UNIX Specification, Motif, and X11 Libraries. Development teams can also use MKS Code Integrity to create a portability model unique to their own organization.<P>
Version 1.1 of MKS Code Integrity is shipping at a special introductory price of US $1500 for Solaris, SunOS, HP/UX, and AIX UNIX platforms. This introductory pricing offer will last until December 31, 1995. Multi-user licensing is also available. A C++ version of the product is expected in early 1996.

Rogue Wave Software has announced the release of Net.h++, an object-oriented interface to network communication services, simplifying client/server and peer-to-peer development. The initial release includes a C++ implementation of the Berkeley socket interface (the programming interface to TCP/IP) and will be portable between UNIX, Windows, and Windows NT. Net.h++'s three-tiered architecture provides a portable framework for working with network channels and protocols. Each layer is built on the one before, and offers increasingly abstract services. A developer can use any or all of the layers of Net.h++, depending on the requirements of the application.<P>
Net.h++ 1.0 includes an IOstream module that handles communication into and out of a portal using the standard C++ IOstream classes and Rogue Wave's virtual streams. The virtual streams classes provide a persistence mechanism for transmitting complicated data structures across a network.<P>
Net.h++ 1.0 will include support for SunOS, Solaris, HP/UX, Windows, and Windows NT. Both source code and object code are available, and pricing starts at $499. Tools.h++ is required for use of Net.h++. For more information contact Rogue Wave Software, Inc., 260 SW Madison, P.O. Box 2328, Corvallis, OR 97339. 800-487-3217 or +1-503-754-3010.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01E9_011D">Softel vdm Releases SftTabs 2.0 for Windows<A name="01E9_011D"></FONT></h4></P>
Softel vdm has announced an update of its tabbed dialog tool kit, SftTabs. SftTabs 2.0 provides tab controls that can be used with dialogs and also with regular windows. The new tab controls support many different styles and tab locations (such as top, left, right, or bottom), including the popular notebook style. Individual tabs can use different colors, display bitmaps or icons, use special fonts, and display multiline text with various alignment options.<P>
The included tab design application allows developers to create the desired tab control look (including colors and bitmaps) and generate the required C or C++ runtime source code.<P>
SftTabs supports development of "wizard"-style dialogs and similar multi-page dialogs that can be switched in response to other Windows controls (such as list boxes, buttons, or Softel vdm's SftTree tree control). Because SftTabs is not restricted to dialogs, it can be used in any kind of window.<P>
Another unusual feature is the available nesting, allowing tab controls (and dialogs) to contain additional tab controls with dialogs.<P>
SftTabs supports Windows 3.1, Win32s, Windows NT, and Windows 95 using the same API, allowing easy migration of applications across the supported platforms. The 16-bit and 32-bit DLLs can be used with C and C++ (MFC and OWL classes are included), or other DLL-capable languages using the SendMessage API.<P>
SftTabs is implemented as a DLL-based custom control, with support for the Windows SDK dialog editor (16- and 32-bit), Microsoft's Visual C++ AppStudio, and Borland's Resource Workshop. SftTabs 2.0 includes sample code written in C and C++ (for both MFC and OWL).<P>
SftTabs 2.0 is offered at $329 (single developer license, without DLL source code) or $478 (single developer license, including DLL source code). Site licensing and volume discounts are available. Each SftTabs license supports Windows 3.1, Windows NT, and Windows 95 and is royalty-free. Technical support is available via telephone, fax, BBS and CompuServe.
