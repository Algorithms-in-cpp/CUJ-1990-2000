<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0231_00BB">Microsoft Releases Visual C++<A name="0231_00BB"></FONT></h4></P>
Microsoft has released the Microsoft Visual C++ development system for the Microsoft Windows operating system. Visual C++ provides an integrated visual development system for C++ programming, with a standard edition replacing QuickC and a professional edition succeeding C/C++ v7.0. The Visual C++ development system includes the following new features: Visual WorkBench, AppStudio, AppWizard, ClassWizard, and Microsoft Foundation CLass Library v2.0.<P>
Visual WorkBench is an integrated, Windows-hosted development environment. A toolbar provides one-click access to common operations. WorkBench provides access to the other tools (AppStudio, AppWizard, and ClassWizard) and provides an integrated Windows-hosted debugger.<P>
AppStudio provides a graphical approach to user interface design, resource editing, and Visual Basic control manipulation. Developers can create and edit the standard Windows-based resources, and they can install Visual Basic custom controls within the AppStudio environment, allowing use of third-party custom controls. AppStudio supports editing of multiple resources concurrently.<P>
AppWizard automates the first steps of using an application framework, creating skeleton application source code files.<P>
ClassWizard automates the process of connecting user interface elements (such as dialog buttons) created in AppStudio to the C++ code that handles them.<P>
The Microsoft Foundation Class v2.0 is an application framework for creating Windows-based applications, and is compatible with v1.0. New classes and capabilities added to v2.0 include printing and print preview, documents and views, toolbar and status bar classes, form and edit views, support for Visual Basic custom controls, scrolling and split-pane windows, OLE classes, dialog data exchange and validation (DDX/DDV), and context-sensitive help.<P>
The professional edition includes MS-DOS application targeting, CodeView for MS-DOS and Windows, Source Profiler for Windows and MS-DOS, and essential components of the Windows v3.1 SDK. The Visual C++ professional edition is $500, (standard edition is $200), with upgrade discounts available. Visual C++ requires MS-DOS v5.0+, MS-Windows v3.1, 4MB RAM (8MB recommended), and 30MB to 50MB of disk space. <I>Contact Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA, 98052-6399, (800)227-4679, extension 11700; FAX (206)936-7329.</I><P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0231_00BD">Columbia University Upgrades Kermit<A name="0231_00BD"></FONT></h4></P>
Columbia University has upgraded their Kermit communications software. C-Kermit Release 5A(188) is distributed as C source code. C-Kermit is portable and consistent across many platforms, including UNIX, VMS, OS/2, Commodore, and Atari.<P>
C-Kermit 5A(188) has added sliding windows (up to 31 window slots), and long packets (up to 9024 bytes). According to the University, by using maximum values, it is possible to have up to 280,000 bytes "in the pipe" before acknowledgment is required, bringing text file transfer efficiency into the 85 percent to 95 percent range before compression. The sliding window transport uses selective retransmission to minimize overhead on noisy connections, and the packet length adapts automatically to noise characteristics. Errors are detected by 16-bit CRC and other methods. Other C-Kermit 5A(188) features include: translation capabilities that have been extended to include East European languages, Cyrillic alphabet languages, and Japanese Kanji; a feature which allows application of language-specific rules when translating text into ASCII; keymapping, keystroke macros, command macros, and a script programming language; accessing, or acting as a Kermit file server with file management and host access functions; and documentation.<P>
C-Kermit 5A(188) supports serial connections, TCP/IP connections, and X.25 connections on Sun computers equipped with SunLink X.25. The price for C-Kermit 5A(188) depends upon the platform. <I>Contact Columbia University, Kermit Distribution, 612 W. 115th St., New York, NY 10025, (212) 854-3703.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0231_00BE">Liant Releases C++/Views for the Macintosh<A name="0231_00BE"></FONT></h4></P>
Liant Software Corp. has released C++/Views for the Macintosh. C++/Views lets programmers develop applications portable across Windows, Presentation Manager, Motif, and Macintosh while avoiding the details of the APIs. Programmers can develop for one GUI and port the source code unchanged to another by recompiling. C++/Views for the Macintosh uses native GUI components to give applications a Macintosh "look and feel." As applications are ported to other environments, the "look and feel" changes to reflect the target GUI. C++/Views provides a library of C++ classes and an interactive class browser. Classes contained in C++/Views include: 100 object classes that form a library of software components to support windows, views, menus, dialogs, bitmaps, graphics, and printers; foundation classes that provide support for runtime type checking, construction, identification, and object persistence; data management classes (containers, collections, sets, and dictionaries); and higher level classes such as VTableView (for tables or simple spreadsheets). C++/Views includes C++/Browse, an interactive object class browsing utility similar to the Small-Talk browser. C++/Views is $3,000. <I>Contact Liant Software Corp., 959 Concord St., Framingham, MA 01701-4613, (508)872-8700; FAX (508)626-2221.</I><P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0231_00C2">Kuck &amp; Associates Release C Preprocessor for IBM RS/6000<A name="0231_00C2"></FONT></h4></P>
Kuck and Associates have Released KAP/C, an optimizing C preprocessor for IBM RS/6000 platforms. RS/6000 users can improve the performance of C programs in a variety of applications including robotics, simulation, and logic design. KAP/C's optimizations automatically restructure C floating-point and integer applications to execute faster on single processor RISC architectures, and improve the object code produced by the IBM XL C compiler.<P>
KAP/C performance improvements have been tested by Kuck &amp; Associates with the SPEC benchmark suites, CFP92 and CINT93. Kuck &amp; Associates state that KAP/C performs particularly well on three C benchmarks: alvinn, ear, and eqntott. The performance improvement users can expect from KAP/C depends on the nature of particular programs and the programming style and optimizations already coded in the program. On single processor workstation, KAP/C's optimizations are most likely to improve performance of C programs which: use significant computation time; use a large data set &#151; the total size of the data must be larger that the cache of the machine, or a portion of each array that is used is larger than the cache; have significant data reuse within a loop nest, for example, matrix multiplication; and have loop nests that use many local arrays.<P>
Additionally, KAP/C performs pointer and I/O analysis to identify optimization opportunities. KAP/C for IBM is $595 per user for a floating license. <I>Contact Kuck and Associates, 1906 Fox Dr., Champaign, IL 61820, (217) 356-2288; FAX (217) 356-5199.</I><P>

MainSoft (MAchine INdependent SOFTware Corporation) has introduced MainWin, a tool for porting MS-Windows applications to UNIX. Using MainWin's compatibility library and toolkit, developers can convert Windows applications written in portable ANSI C to UNIX systems supporting X Window and POSIX. MainWin uses the Windows API and the application is natively implemented on Xlib. Developers do not have to rewrite source code and the application runs under UNIX at the same level as the Windows version runs under MS-Windows.<P>
With MainWin, a converted application appears and behaves like the original Windows application. MainWin, as a native port to UNIX, avoids the tradeoffs in performance, maintainablility, and upgradeability of emulators and other layered software approaches. MainWin Software Development kits are dedicated to specific UNIX architectures, with support for Solaris v2.1, UNIXWare vl.0, AIX v3.2 for RS 6000, and HP-UX v8.0. MainWin supports Windows v3.0, with an upgrade to Windows v3.1 due later this year. <I>Contact Machine Independent Software Corp., 185 BerrySt., Suite 5411, San Francisco, CA 94107, (800) 624-6946; FAX (415) 896-0709.</I><P>
