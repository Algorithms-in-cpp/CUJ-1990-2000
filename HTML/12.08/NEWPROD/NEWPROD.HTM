<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0169_00BD">Lucid Announces Agreement with Rogue Wave<A name="0169_00BD"></FONT></h4></P>
Lucid, Inc. has announced an agreement with Rogue Wave Software, Inc. to bundle its Tools.h++ class library with Lucid's C++ compiler and integrated C/C++ development software, Energize. Lucid will also distribute Rogue Wave libraries targeted at specific vertical applications.<P>
The Tools.h++ library is a general-purpose set of 100 C++ classes. The kit includes data structure classes and a set of collection classes modeled after Smalltalk-80. Energize, a C/C++ development environment, supports integration with configuration management systems, GUI builders and toolkits, and utilities. Lucid C++ is a native C++ compiler providing "small and fast" executables for both C and C++.<P>
Lucid will distribute the object code version of Tools.h++ at no additional charge to customers. The source code version will be available for an additional fee. Lucid will make versions of other Rogue Wave libraries available including Money.h++, for handling decimals with arbitrary precision, and View.h++, a C++ interface to Motif.<P>
Energize is $4,250 for a single unit, or $2,950 per unit for ten. Site licenses and educational discounts are available. Lucid C++ is $1,095. For more information contact <I>Lucid, Inc., 707 Laurel St., Menlo Park, CA 94025; (415) 329-8400; FAX: (415)329-8480</I>.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0169_00BE">MetaWare Ships High C/C++ for OS/2 v2.1<A name="0169_00BE"></FONT></h4></P>
MetaWare Inc. has begun shipping MetaWare High C/C++ compiler for OS/2 v2.1 that includes DirectToSOM support for IBM's System Object Model (SOM) and cross-platform Distributed SOM (DSOM). DirectToSOM lets developers create SOM binaries by compiling standard C++ source code.<P>
High C/C++ for OS/2 v2.1 includes SOM and DSOM kernel code, which is licensed from IBM. The supporting components are also included. Developers can move existing C++ code to SOM by recompiling with the High C/C++ compiler. Thereafter, recompiling will be needed only when source code changes are made.<P>
With this compiler, third-party class library providers no longer need to ship their source code on OS/2; only the SOM objects are needed. Later, the SOM objects can be replaced without recompiling other dependent objects. Similar advantages exist for inhouse developers, permitting greater control over source code and avoiding recompilation of derived subclasses.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0169_00C0">Expersoft Announces XShell v3.0<A name="0169_00C0"></FONT></h4></P>
Expersoft Corporation has announced XShell v3.0, a distributed object management environment (DOME), which includes the XShell Distributed ORB (object request broker), and a suite of integrated tools and services. XShell v3.0's tools and services include: XShell Security, a distributed object service that provides dynamic authentication and access control management to objects in the XShell DOME; and XShell TP Manager, a distributed object service that supports two-phase commit and roll-back on object operation. Other components of XShell v3.0 include: XShell Rules, a rules-based extension to C++ for building intelligent distributed objects; XShell Fuzzy, an interactive development and run-time environment for building fuzzy logic-based XShell objects; and XShell IDL Compiler, a COBRA-compliant IDL for generating bindings to OO languages, including C++, SmallTalk, and Objective C.<P>
The XShell Distributed ORB, based on C++, defines how objects are identified, located, and manipulated across a network. XShell Distributed ORB uses a combination of remote interface object technology and a distributed daemon architecture to distribute objects throughout the network. The XShell Distributed ORB removes address space restriction by letting objects migrate between address spaces. Users build objects in C++ that can be used in remote processes to create the illusion of locality. Daemons are installed on every node in an XShell environment to form the backbone of the XShell execution environment. The daemon architecture handles process control, object creation, connection management, and access to other XShell tools. XShell also supports asynchronous messaging and encapsulation of legacy code.<P>
