<pre>
                 A way to echo
                 small letters as
                 capitals.

<B>                    Specification</B></pre>
<pre>
   We will write a C program that will read a
   character from a terminal device and echo
   back to the terminal device a capital when
   small letters are detected. Printable
   characters other than small letters will be echoed
   back unchanged.

<B>                    Test Plan</B></pre>
<pre>
Randomly generate characters. Pass if printable
characters other than small letters are echoed back
exactly as sent. Pass if small letters are echoed back
as capitals. Fail if other occurs.</pre>
