<p>While mastering COM may take time, take heart! There are many books on the subject
including one by Microsoft Press titled, Inside COM. I find it a readable and
useful reference. Also, check out The Essence of OLE with ActiveX by David
Platt after you get basic COM under your belt. He uses a workbook step-by-step
approach that leverages your knowledge of COM and illustrates some key
components of OLE and ActiveX. It's an excellent sample source. And, of course,
there is always Kraig Brockshmidt's authoritive work on OLE entitiled, Inside
OLE. It's big, it's dense, it can be tough reading, but everything is in
there.<p>
Since Microsoft is not only preaching COM, but writing applications based on
it, you might take a look at Microsoft Transaction Server (based on COM) to get
a sense of COM in a commercial context. The Windows 95/NT shell is also written
in COM, so any programming books you encounter on the subject will have a lot
of COM content.<p>
Also, if you are interested in developing COM objects for non-Windows
platforms, or integrating COM with other distributed object architectures, you
might find the following articles of interest:</p>
