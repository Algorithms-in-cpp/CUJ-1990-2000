<p>COM Servers come in two flavors: in-process and out-of-process. Basically, the
in-process server is a DLL (Dynamic Link Library) in Win32 or a shared library
on other operating systems. By contrast, an out-of-process server is an
executable. Each have their advantages and disadvantages. The COM in-process
server is actually loaded into the process space of the calling application,
which means greater speed, but also means the calling application will crash if
the the COM object misbehaves. Out-of-process servers exist in a different
process space from the calling client, which means all function arguments and
return values must be "marshalled" between the two address spaces. This in
turn means slower speed but a more robust implementation. DCOM servers are
often out-of-process servers (EXEs), but an in-process COM compononent can act
as a DCOM server if it is "wrapped" in a special type of executable called a
surrogate. COM provides a default surrogate for in-process COM servers that
want to be DCOM servers; or you can write your own. o
