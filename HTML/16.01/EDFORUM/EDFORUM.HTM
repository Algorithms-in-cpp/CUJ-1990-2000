<blockquote>
<p>Every few years, I'm obliged to write an editorial that's not a lot of fun
for me. The Managing Editor I've learned to depend on moves on to bigger and
better things. The good part is that I get to praise the departing ME, in ways
that I probably should have earlier but never got around to doing. The bad part
is that I have to start all over with a new recruit, mastering the art of
shifting as much of my work as possible to unsuspecting shoulders. Like a
perennial high school teacher, I get to watch my charges move on while I stay
in place.<p>
And now, for something completely different. This is not that editorial, at
least not exactly.<p>
Marc Briand is easily the strongest ME I've ever had the pleasure to work with.
And I've worked with some good ones over the years, as Senior Editor for this
magazine, as Technical or Contributing Editor to other Miller Freeman
offerings, or just as a columnist for all of the above. It's been clear to me
for some time that Marc can do a lot more for CUJ than serve as its ME, however
well he has held down that post. More recently, it has become clear to others
that this is true &#151; including Marc.<p>
But Marc is not moving on, at least not exactly. Instead, he's moving up within
CUJ. Since Senior Editor is the next rung up the ladder, and I'm sitting on
that rung, you might anticipate a problem. There is none. I'm staying right
where I am and Marc is moving above me. His new title is Editor in Chief, a
post he richly deserves. It's not often that your nominal subordinate becomes
your superior, but this is one of those times for me.<p>
I'm quite content to continue in my role &#151; ensuring that CUJ remains
technically both relevant and accurate. Marc will take an ever increasing role
in shaping the tone and direction of the magazine. We see eye to eye on most
policy issues, so don't expect any sudden lurches. In fact, my biggest worry is
that Marc will warn the next Managing Editor about all my techniques for
shifting work.</p>

<p>Publisher's Note:  CUJ is extremely lucky to have the services of two such
able editors. From the The Elements of Programming Style through The Draft
Standard C++ Library and his many years with CUJ, P.J. Plauger has helped shape
programming as it is practiced today. Marc Briand made a mid-course correction
four years ago, coming to the editorship of CUJ from a position as senior
instrumentation engineer with Beech Aircraft  Company  his unusual combination
of technical and editing skills has strengthened CUJ immeasurably.  With the
new editorial configuration, CUJ readers can expect continued excellence and
ever greater relevance to their programming  needs. - M.M.
