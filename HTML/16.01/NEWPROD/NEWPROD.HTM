letters, which can result in a better match rate, but also takes up more
computer storage space. The length of the codes (Soundex, Extended Soundex, and
Metaphone) is selectable through a property.<p>
SoundX/X costs $20, plus shipping and handling. SoundX/X with Microsoft Visual
C++ v5 source code costs $50. SoundX/X is royalty-free.<p>
