<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="017D_00E4">CenterLine Announces QualityCenter Automated Testing Tools<A name="017D_00E4"></FONT></h4></P>
CenterLine Software, Inc. has released QualityCenter, their family of automated software testing tools to help development organizations improve the quality and speed of developing software applications. While traditional approaches separate testing from the development process, making quality assurance a post-development endeavor, CenterLine's QualityCenter family allows companies to flush out defects in their code earlier in the development process. By combining QualityCenter with CenterLine's ObjectCenter and CodeCenter programming environments, the company now offers the industry a broad range of C/C++ software development solutions to enable quality-centered development, from the first compile through deployment.<P>
The QualityCenter family includes QC/Replay, QC/Coverage, QC/Sim, and TestCenter. QC/Replay automates the process of capturing and replaying user keystrokes and mouse clicks to uncover deviations in an X-Window application's behavior early in the development cycle. QC/Replay combines "widget awareness" (in which test scripts interact directly with Motif buttons, scroll bars, and other GUI building-block objects), an open, standard scripting language, and automatic synchronization to provide object-based capture/playback verification of complex applications. QC/Replay's widget-based approach enables tests which are more readable, maintainable, and resilient to changes. QC/Coverage provides a code coverage and analysis tool for test planning and measuring how much of an application's code was exercised during testing. QC/Coverage provides industry standard testing metrics to assist in test planning with specialized support for the C++ language. QC/Sim is an add-on to QC/Coverage for simulating difficult-to-test situations, such as disk or network failures. Together QC/Coverage and QC/Sim enable users to remove hidden defects by simulating real-life conditions. TestCenter supplies a testing tool for run-time error and memory leak detection together with code coverage capabilities.<P>
Products in the QualityCenter family are priced at $6,995 for QC/Replay, $5,995 for QC/Coverage (C), $8,995 for QC/Coverage (C++), $9,600 for QC/Sim, and $3,995 for TestCenter. All prices are for a single floating license. Most QualityCenter family members run on the following platforms: HP-UX 9.0, SunOS/Solaris, IBM AIX, UnixWare, Digital UNIX, OS/2.
