<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00DC_008F">IST Ships X-Designer 4<A name="00DC_008F"></FONT></h4></P>
Imperial Software Technology (IST) has begun shipping X-Designer 4, a cross-platform, graphical user-interface builder. X-Designer 4 allows users to generate classes based on the Microsoft Foundation Class library, with the objective of allowing developers to build classes with a common definition but distinct implementations for Motif or Windows. X-Designer 4 can generate three distinct "flavors" of C++ code: Motif, Motif MFC, and Windows MFC. X-Designer generates calls to the native toolkits only, i.e., the standard Motif and X libraries, or the Microsoft Foundation Class libraries. When X-Designer generates code for the MFC based classes, it maps the primitive widgets to an instance of an equivalent MFC class. So, for example, a <I>PushButton</I> widget maps to an instance of the <I>Cbutton</I> class; a text widget maps to an instance of <I>Cedit</I> class. Some of the resources can also be mapped through; the <I>XmNlabel</I> String for a Push Button maps to a call to <I>SetWindow-Text( )</I> for the <I>Cbutton</I>. X-Designer includes Hypertext Help, a layout editor, unlimited undo, and the ability to generate C/C++ code and a wide range of widgets. These widgets include the XRT set from KL Group, the full INT widget set, the GL widget set from Silicon Graphics, and the Athena widget set.<P>
X-Designer 4 is priced at $3,500 and available for SunOS 4 and Solaris 2.4, with support planned for Spring 1995, on the following platforms: HP, IBM RS/6000, SGI, Digital, and SCO.
