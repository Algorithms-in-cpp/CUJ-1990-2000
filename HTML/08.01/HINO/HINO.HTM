<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0043_001E">CUG297 &#151; Small Prolog<A name="0043_001E"></FONT></h4></P>
Henri de Feraudy (France) has submitted a public domain Prolog interpreter. His Small Prolog follows a Cambridge syntax (LISP-like syntax) that has advantages for meta-programming and small code. The Small Prolog includes most of standard built-in (predicates) based on Clocksin and Mellish's descriptions in <I>Programming in Prolog,</I> although it can be extended by creating more user defined built-ins. The disk includes C source files, make files, documentation, and many Prolog example files that demonstrate Prolog features for C programmers who may be unfamiliar with Prolog. The source code is very portable and will compile under Turbo C v1.5 and Mark William Let's C v4 on PC clones, Mark William C v3.0 and Megamax Laser C on Atari ST and Sun C compiler on Sun-3.<P>

Jeffrey S. Dean has contributed PC Curses, v0.8. This shareware release of PC curses is a C window functions library designed to provide compatibility with the UNIX curses package. By fully utilizing the PC features, this package is coded much simpler than the UNIX version. For example, there is no need for cursor motion and screen output optimization on PC. Currently, there are two major versions of curses database under UNIX; one is termcap, the other terminfo. However, PC curses derives primarily from the former version, with some features of the latter version. Moreover, additional routines (not in the original curses package) are provided for the PC user. The distribution disk includes a couple of demo programs, Small and Large model library for Microsoft C v5.0 and Turbo C v1.5 compilers, and documentation that describes all the functions in the library. The source code is obtained by paying a $20 fee directly to the author.<P>

Phillip A. Mongelluzzo (CT) from Star Guidance Consulting has submitted Revision 07.01.89 of The Window Boss. This release provides additional data entry routines along with support for user-defined physical sizes (i.e. 43 and 50 line EGA/VGA screen sizes).<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0043_0022">CUG198 &#151; MicroEmacs Source<A name="0043_0022"></FONT></h4></P>
Willam Bader has extensively updated a text editor, MicroEmacs v3.9. His update includes not only bug fixes of the old version, but also additional commands, portability improvement, and performance enhancement.<P>
The new feautures of MicroEmacs are built-in emulation DEC EDT editor support for VT100/VT200 keypads, function keys and scrolling regions, better VMS support such as filter-buffer command and preservation of record format attributes, extra commands such as insert a C format octal escape sequence, scroll the screen horizontally, callable interface of Emacs (you can call Emacs as a function), VMS subshell routines, support for ANSI color, BINARY mode for MS-DOS, pull-down menu, and more.<P>
The enhancements include a faster search routine, faster lookup for normal keys and FNC macro, faster display routine.<P>
Bader has tested the new version of MicroEmacs using the following compilers and operating systems:<P>
VAX11c under VMS4.1 on VAX-11/750, Microsoft C 5.0 under MS-DOS 3.20, Turbo C 1.5 under MS-DOS 3.20, CI86 2.30J under MS-DOS 3.20, Microsoft C under XENIX 386, cc under SunOS 3.5 on Sun 3/360C, cc under SunOS 4.0 on Sun 386i, cc under BSD 2.9 on PDP-11/70.<P>
In order to create an executable code for your environment, you need to turn on/off the switches of Machine/OS definitions, Compiler definitions, Terminal Output definitions, and Configuration options in the header file, <I>estruct.h.</I> The distribution setting is to compile under MS-DOS using Turbo C.</FONT></FONT><P>
