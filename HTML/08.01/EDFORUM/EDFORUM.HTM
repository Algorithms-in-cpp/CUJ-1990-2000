<A name="004B_0000"><A name="004B_0000">To show our appreciation for your readership and to commemorate <I>The C Users Journal's</I> second anniversary, we've bound a combination calendar and reference card into this issue. P.J. Plauger prepared the reference card. It summarizes calling conventions for Standard C library functions. Susan, our staff artist, prepared the calendar. We hope you find at least one side useful.<P>
This issue begins our third year of publishing <I>The C Users Journal</I>. It also marks our first issue on a monthly publication cycle.<P>
Two years ago, when we first combined <I>The C Journal</I> and <I>The C Users Group Newsletter</I>, the Journal was 72 pages and went to 6800 subscribers. This issue of 144 pages will be distributed to over 23,000 subscribers; another 5400 copies will go to newsstand distributors.<P>
The magazine and related activities now employ 16 persons &#151; up from about ten a year ago. To accommodate this extra staff, we've just moved into larger quarters, about two blocks from our old office. (We're all moved in, but we're not yet 100 percent functional. There are still little things missing &#151; like my terminal, and Donna's doorknob, and Kenji's return air vent, and ...)<P>
We think all these signs are cause to celebrate. (Well, maybe all but the moving ... that's pretty traumatic.) Since it's your interest in C that has stimulated this activity, we wanted to share the celebration with you. Unfortunately, it's difficult to coordinate a celebration involving over 23,000 persons scattered around the globe. We considered mailing you each a party favor with instructions about when to toot your whistle, but the reference card seemed more practical. If nothing else, we're always practical. (Personally, I'm celebrating by trying to catch up on some lost sleep.)<P>
We hope you like the card. We offer it with our heartfelt gratitude; thanks for reading the magazine, thanks for writing for the magazine, and thanks for advertising in the magazine. We'll be doing our best to earn your continued participation.<P>
Sincerely yours,<P>
Robert Ward<br>
Editor/Publisher<P>
