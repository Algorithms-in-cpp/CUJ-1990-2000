<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="004D_0025">Oasys Offers Green Hills C++<A name="004D_0025"></FONT></h4></P>
Oasys, Inc. has introduced the Green Hills C++ compiler, which supports cross and native mode development. Green Hills C++ is integrated with the Oasys 680x0 and 88000 Cross Tool Kits, enabling embedded systems developers to take advantage of object-oriented techniques. Green Hills C++ supports Kernighan and Ritchie C and complies with ANSI C standard.<P>
Green Hills C++ provides object oriented programming features such as data abstraction, strong type checking, and overloading of function names and operators. New C++ features include classes with scope, and overloading new and arrow operators. Green Hills C++ also includes compiler optimizing techniques such as inlining, loop unrolling and register caching.<P>
Green Hills C++ compiler is available from Oasys on the Sun-3. Oasys claims that the compiler will be ported to other UNIX workstation and minicomputers soon.<P>
Oasys supports Designer C++, the C++ translator developed by Glockenspiel, Ltd. Oasys will provide current customers with the ability to upgrade to the Green Hills C++ compiler.<P>
For more information contact Oasys at 230 Second Ave., Waltham, MA 02154 (617) 890-7889; FAX (617) 890-4644.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="004D_0026">Library Brings UNIX Functions To Hercules Card Users<A name="004D_0026"></FONT></h4></P>
Certified Scientific Software has announced a subroutine package that allows programmers using most PC-based UNIX systems to take full advantage of Hercules-type monochrome graphics adapters. The package includes the standard UNIX plot(3) subroutines plus many enhancements, such as patterned fills of circles, rectangles and user-defined shapes; two fonts &#151; 8x8 pixel and 8x16 pixel &#151; for labels; clipping windows; five pixel write-modes, including bit-set, bit-clear and exclusive-or; and routines to support double buffering using the Hercules adapter's two graphics pages, making animation effects possible.<P>
The subroutines use only integer code, so they will run efficiently whether or not floating-point hardware is installed. A 10-page manual and demonstration C code is included.<P>
The package is currently available for Interactive Systems 386/ix; AT&amp;T Sytem V/386; Microport System V/AT; XENIX 286 v2.2/2.3 and 386 v2.3; and VENIX v2.3/2.4.<P>
A single-user license is priced at $99, plus $2 shipping and handling. The subroutines may be licensed for incorporation in programs for resale by special arrangement.<P>
For more information or a review copy, contact Certified Scientific Software, P.O. Box 802168, Chicago, IL 60680 (312) 326-6098. Send e-mail to: UUCP:{seismo,harpo,ihnp4, linus,allegra}!harvard!certif!herc INTERNET:certif!herc@ harvard. harvard.edu<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="004D_0027">Screen Manager Professional Updated To Version 1.5B<A name="004D_0027"></FONT></h4></P>
Logical Alternatives, Inc. has released version 1.5B of the Screen Manager Professional for C programmers. The S.M.P. is a tool box of over 150 pre-written functions for complex windowing, menu generation and interactive context sensitive help features.<P>
To maximize performance and minimize memory overhead, the windowing functions are written in assembly language. The smallest possible program size using the S.M.P. functions is approximately 7K. The menu system, on the other hand, is written in C, providing flexibility and allowing the programmer to customize the function.<P>
Other features include: keyboard filtering for data entry systems, OS and compiler independence, full video support, background processing, reconfigurable memory allocation, and a 300-page ring bound manual. This product also includes an event driven mouse support system, which makes S.M.P. comparable to a text-based Microsoft Windows programming interface. Full technical support is available including a new bulletin board for professional programmers: The LAB (814) 234-1881.<P>
The introductory price for S.M.P. v1.5B is $250, (with source code, $350). Screen Manager Professional supports Microsoft C, Borland's Turbo C, Watcom C, Lattice C, and Zortech C++.<P>

Hansco Information Technologies, Inc. has released its new terminal emulator system, HIT/Ansi.<P>
HIT/Ansi is a memory-resident program for MS-DOS compatible computers that emulate the Xenix color console. The program may be called up while running any MS-DOS application with a hot key so that the computer functions as a terminal to a host Xenix machine. When the hot key is pressed again, the computer returns to MS-DOS and to whatever program was running.<P>
Using less than 48K of RAM, HIT/Ansi supports color (CGA, EGA, and VGA) or monochrome systems, 12 function keys and local printers in the foreground or background through the parallel port.<P>
A descriptive brochure and demonstration diskette for the product are available upon request.<P>
