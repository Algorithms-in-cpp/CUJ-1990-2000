<A name="00A6_0000"><A name="00A6_0000">By the time you read these words, the first public review of the draft C++ Standard should be under way. If you want to find out how to participate, send an e-mail message to <I>c++std-notify@research.att.com</I><I>.</I> The message content is unimportant and will be ignored.<P>
The C Standard was developed by ANSI rules, then adopted by ISO. As a consequence, it went through two rather protracted public reviews, each of which mandated that committee X3J11 respond formally to all public comments. By contrast, the C++ Standard is being developed under ISO rules. ANSI is just one participant, on behalf of the USA, albeit a rather large and active one.<P>
You will find, as a result, that the opportunity for reviewing the draft C++ Standard and submitting comments is rather brief. Electronic mail has come a long way since the C Standard was developed, so there is compensating technology. I expect, for example, that the draft will be available at a public ftp site for downloading by all concerned. And you will probably be able to submit comments via e-mail &#151; though a hard-copy followup is always prudent if you value paper trails.<P>
I can report happily that committees X3J16 and WG21 are taking convergence rather more seriously. At the March 1995 meeting in Austin, Texas, they actually rejected a couple of interesting proposals out of hand purely on the grounds of being too late in the game. You will find more than a few rough spots in the current draft out for balloting, but not so many with paint still drying on them. Enjoy your reviewing.<P>
On another topic, I must sadly report that Chuck Allison is terminating his "Code Capsules" column with this issue. He has simply become too busy with his day job to keep up the level of effort required. Rather than compromise the quality of his writing, he has chosen to end his contributions to <I>CUJ</I>.<P>
The good news is that he has been made a bishop in the Church of Latter Day Saints, a post he richly deserves from what I know of him. I first met Chuck at a C++ Standards meeting about three years ago and was immediately struck by his friendly forthrightness. I was not surprised to find that he also has a talent for explaining technical issues clearly and simply. The Church was wise to elevate him, in my opinion.<P>
The other good news is that Chuck has agreed, at last, to assemble his Code Capsules into a book. I've been on his case to do so for years, and I don't expect him to get the job done overnight. Not with the press of other professional obligations. But at least he's begun the process. We'll let you know when the book will appear.<P>
The problem with writers, as with most technical experts, is that all the really good ones are pretty busy. That's why you see a steady turnover of contributors, to <I>CUJ</I> and other magazines. Not to worry, however. We have a few more busy people waiting in the wings to take up the challenge.<P>
