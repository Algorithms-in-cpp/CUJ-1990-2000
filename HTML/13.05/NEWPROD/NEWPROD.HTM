<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00A8_006A">Object Intl. Ships Together/C++ Version 1.2<A name="00A8_006A"></FONT></h4></P>
Object Intl. has announced Together/C++ V1.2 TC++ 1.2 includes these new features: automatic production of documentation; ready-for-Windows help file generation; additional object model features, including attribute types, service parameters, return value types, and drag-and-drop connection changes; additional language-specific features, such as configurable header files and code files, private attributes and public services by default; a new tool bar; more extensive online help; and no more hardware key.<P>
Together/C++ allows developers to work with either the object model or the code at any point in the development process, switching between the two as often as needed. Both object model and code can be updated in sync with each other, at the touch of a button.<P>
Together/C++ also includes the following: an object modeling and C++ programming environment, with synchronization between the formats; automatic, semi-automatic, and manual layout of object models; object modeling view management; a C++ parser; integration with other C++ tools, such as editors, class libraries, or GUI builders; documentation generation based on predefined templates; and a multi-user version (TC++ Team).<P>
TC++ Solo targets individual developers and is priced at $997. TC++ Team adds multi-user capability and more flexible document generation. For more information contact <I>Object Intl., 8140 N. MoPac 4-200, Austin, TX 78759; +1-512-795-0202; FAX: +1-512-795-0332; e-mail: info@oi.com.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00A8_006B">Blue Sky Ships WinMaker Pro 6.0<A name="00A8_006B"></FONT></h4></P>
Blue Sky Software has begun shipping WinMaker Pro 6.0, a prototyper and C/C++ code generator for Windows, Windows 95, and Windows NT, which provides a visual interface similar to Visual Basic. WinMaker Pro 6.0 supports VBX controls &#151; users can add VBX controls to the customizable floating Toolbox and drag and drop the controls into their applications' dialog boxes and screens.<P>
WinMaker Pro 6.0 also includes three royalty-free VBX controls. The Progress Bar VBX displays progress bars with percentage, for status reporting. The LED VBX behaves like an LED, allowing the display of passive on/off indicators (e.g., model lights). The Bar-code VBX supports creation of bar-codes for inventory applications, identification systems, etc. 3-D effects, fonts, and colors for the controls can be defined by WinMaker users.<P>
WinMaker's visual environment is similar to Visual Basic. With WinMaker Pro 6.0, developers can draw and test the user interface for an application without writing code. WinMaker Pro's Project Manager provides access to all objects and resources. Three floating palettes provide convenient access: a property sheet, a toolbox, and a color &amp; font palette. WinMaker's Preview Mode allows developers to edit and test an application before compilation. Integrated Switch-It code generation modules (SIMs) generate MFC C++, OWL C++, and ANSI C code.<P>
WinMaker Pro 6.0 has a suggested list price of $995, but is being introduced for a limited time with a price of $499. Windows-Maker 5 users can upgrade to WinMaker Pro 6.0 for $199.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00A8_006C">ObjectSpace Introduces STL&lt;Toolkit&gt;<A name="00A8_006C"></FONT></h4></P>
ObjectSpace, Inc. has announced an enhanced version of the Standard Template Library. ObjectSpace's STL&lt;Toolkit&gt; is a cross-platform commercial implementation of STL, offers multi-threading extensions, including read and write locking, and is compatible with cfront-based compilers. STL&lt;Toolkit&gt; provides support for MS-Windows, UNIX, or OS/2 environments.<P>
The Standard Template Library (STL), was developed by Alex Stepanov and Meng Lee of Hewlett-Packard Laboratories. STL is a powerful, efficient, and flexible set of reusable collections and algorithms. STL was accepted in July, 1994 by the ANSI/ISO Standards Committee as part of the emerging standard for C++. HP placed its version of STL into the public domain.<P>
STL &lt;Toolkit&gt; comes bundled with ThreadKit, ObjectSpace's library, which includes classes for threads, semaphores, and object locking. ThreadKit uses a template-based approach to object locking which allows developers to read or write lock any object without having to write or inherit from any additional classes. Besides ThreadKit, ObjectSpace describes STL&lt;Toolkit&gt; as including the following features: a comprehensive tutorial and class catalog, hundreds of examples, a rigorous test suite, and fully commented source code.<P>
STL&lt;Toolkit&gt; will be bundled free with ObjectSpace's product, ObjectSystems, or it can be purchased separately at an introductory price of $149. For more information contact <I>ObjectSpace, Inc., 14881 Quorum Dr., Suite 400, Dallas, TX 75240, +1-214-934-2496; FAX: +1-214-663-3959; e-mail: Imccaf@objectSpace.com.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00A8_006D">Vireo Upgrades VtoolsD<A name="00A8_006D"></FONT></h4></P>
Vireo Software, Inc. has announced version 1.1 of VtoolsD for Windows 3.1, an update with tools for building VxDs targeted for Windows for Workgroups 3.11 which also adds support for Borland's C++ compiler. Version 1.1 of VtoolsD is a VxD (Virtual Device Driver) toolkit for C/C++ which supports the advanced driver architecture of Windows for Workgroups 3.11. The new version also introduces PELE (PE to LE converter), a utility which supports VxD development with the 32-bit Borland C++ compiler.<P>
VtoolsD supports access to the Network Device Interface Specification (NDIS) libraries provided by Microsoft. VtoolsD also supports access to the VCOMM (Virtual Communications Device) architecture. VtoolsD supports building dynamically loadable VxDs, using the new VxD loader shipped with WfWG. VtoolsD's PELE translator converts standard 32-bit DLLs from the PE format used by Win32 applications to the LE file format require for VxDs, eliminating the need to use a linker that supports the VxD file format. VtoolsD eliminates the need to use the Microsoft DDK to create VxDs.<P>
VtoolsD is priced at $495. Current customers may upgrade for $75, and those who have purchased VtoolsD within 30 days may receive the version 1.1 update free.
