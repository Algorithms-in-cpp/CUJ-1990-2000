               <p>Trade shows are a good place to hobnob
                    with readers and developers, and to find out what new stuff
                    the vendors have cooking. I recently attended the Embedded
                    Systems West conference (September 29 through October 2) in
                    San Jose. Here's a brief report on it.</p>
               
               <p> ESC West was a pretty big show this
                    year &#151; attendance was estimated at 20 per cent over what
                    Miller Freeman (the show producers) anticipated. Evidently
                    the embedded market is heating up. I can see three reasons
                    why: the increasing popularity of wearable silicon, in the
                    form of pagers, PDAs, cell phones, and who knows what; the
                    recently initiated courtship between the Internet and
                    embedded systems; and Moore's Law behind it all, expanding
                    and blurring the boundaries between what is embedded and
                    what is not. If you do any programming involving real-time
                    or networking, don't be surprised if you wake up some
                    morning and find yourself an embedded systems programmer.</p>
               
               <p> Java was the virtual star of this
                    year's show, where "virtual" is defined not as "all but
                    certain" but "not really here." Ten of the 129 classes
                    were devoted to Java, and a couple of them were packed, so
                    you'd think there must be some really hot embedded Java
                    demos out on the show floor. Nope. Instead, I just saw
                    another demo of Java's magical ability to gain acceptance
                    long before its arrival. Several vendors have expressed
                    their determination to "make Java work" in embedded
                    systems, which is pretty amazing considering how far it is
                    from being practical in the current embedded environment.</p>
               
               <p> If someone asked you to choose a
                    language to be ported to an embedded system, would you pick
                    one that was 50 times slower than C, needed 1 MB of RAM to
                    run, and had non-deterministic timing behavior? This group
                    of vendors have answered with a "Yes." I must conclude
                    from all this that someone out there has a powerful thirst
                    for Java, or something like it, either for portability's
                    sake or as an alternative to big bad C++.</p>
               
               <p> The two biggest obstacles to embedded
                    Java are the blazing slowness of byte-code interpreters and
                    the unpredictable timing of Java's standard garbage
                    collector. The most likely solution is an ahead-of-time
                    compiler that translates Java into native object code, with
                    native code libraries that implement a more sociable garbage
                    collector. Two vendors revealed plans to provide for
                    ahead-of-time compilation: Cygnus Solutions
                    (www.cygnus.com), and our own Senior Editor, P.J. Plauger
                    (www.dinkumware.com). Plauger is working with Edison Design
                    Group to implement a Java compiler front end. In its
                    Java-to-C mode, it takes a less direct route to native code,
                    but the principle is basically the same. And as Plauger
                    explained in his talk, there are some clear benefits to
                    having a translator spit out C when the target is an
                    embedded system.</p>
               
               <p> NewMonics, Inc. has taken a different
                    tack on making Java embeddable. Back in August they started
                    licensing PERC, a highly optimized Java Virtual Machine.
                    NewMonics says PERC's garbage collector is both incremental
                    and deterministic. Someone in high places must find PERC
                    significant &#151; DARPA just awarded NewMonics a $1.3 Million
                    contract for further development.</p>
               
               <p> On the non-Java front, Intrinsa is
                    bringing Prefix, their compile-time debugging product, to
                    the embedded world (www.intrinsa.com). I've always been
                    intrigued by Intrinsa's Software Component Simulation (SCS),
                    the technology underlying Prefix. But clever as SCS may be,
                    I've also wondered what it could do for you that a good lint
                    couldn't. Maybe a lot: at the Intrinsa booth I saw Prefix
                    flag an intermittent semaphore leak, just the sort of bug
                    that pushes otherwise sane programmers over the edge.</p>
               
               <p> You too can be an embedded OS, if
                    you're Windows NT and you're running Imagination Systems'
                    Hyperkernel (www.imagination.com). The Hyperkernel inserts
                    itself between the hardware and NT, and alternates
                    processing with NT. If NT crashes (which I know would never
                    happen), the Hyperkernel keeps running, allowing graceful
                    recovery from whatever ails the system.</p>
               
               <p> Those of you who put away the
                    soldering iron years ago to become code pounders may get a
                    kick out of the Benistor, "an amazing new development in
                    controllable electron valves" exhibited by Bensys
                    Corporation (www.bensys.com). I confess I didn't have time
                    to stop at their booth. From what I could gather, the
                    Benistor is some sort of active device that's sprouted about
                    five more leads than a normal transistor. Hook it up one way
                    and you can levitate trains, another way and you receive
                    transmissions from Vega.</p>
               
               <p> Last and least, two guys at the Sun
                    booth, whom I will call Dumb and Dumber, pitched their
                    company's wares via deliberate buffoonery an annoying trend
                    at trade shows. They got their audience to recite "If
                    you're going to do Network Programming, you have to come to
                    Sun." Or something like that. Trinket: a pair of toy
                    binoculars, and they even warned us not to look at the sun
                    with them.</p>
