               <p>Wall Data Incorporated has introduced
                    RUMBA OBJECTX Development Kit 1.1, for building Internet and
                    LAN-based custom applications. The kit, which allows
                    developers to tailor the ActiveX Controls developed by Wall
                    Data for its RUMBA OFFICE 95/NT universal connectivity
                    suite, provides methods for distribution of enterprise
                    applications via corporate intranets or the Internet.</p>
               
               <p> New features include Individual
                    Control Installs, which are ActiveX controls reduced to the
                    smallest possible footprint. The RUMBA OBJECTX Development
                    Kit 1.1 also includes custom HTML samples that demonstrate
                    how to download controls via intranets or the Internet.</p>
               
               <p> The RUMBA OBJECTX Development Kit 1.1
                    costs $1,000 per developer; copy-licensing information for
                    deployed applications is available from Wall Data. For more

               <p>Green Hills Software has announced its
                    MULTI Development Environment and family of C, C++, Fortran,
                    and Ada 95 optimizing compilers for Motorola's new
                    superscalar PowerPC 740 and 750 RISC CPUs. MULTI's
                    integrated debug, program build, profiling, and
                    version-control facilities simplify the development of
                    complex software for the PowerPC 740 and 750. Green Hills'
                    optimizing compilers use advanced scheduling algorithms that
                    enable designers to take advantage of the processing
                    potential of the Power PC 740/750's dual-issue superscalar
                    architecture.</p>
               
               <p> Based on an RTOS-aware source-level
                    debugger, MULTI features task- and system-level debug
                    capabilities. The debugger provides special support for C++
                    (including a Class Browser, object display, and template
                    debug capability), Ada95 (including a type inheritance

               <p>XVT Software Inc. has announced XVT
                    Development Solution for the Internet (XVT-DSI). XVT-DSI
                    uses an application browser technology that allows users to
                    access and run any type of application across the Internet,
                    while still maintaining the client machine's look-and-feel
                    and performance.</p>
               
               <p> At the core of XVT-DSI is a
                    transmitter/receiver technology that packetizes pertinent
                    GUI-related events and data. To further optimize
                    performance, XVT has encapsulated each windowing systems'
                    event model and normalized each subsystem. Therefore,
                    XVT-DSI sends very little data across the Internet to XVT
                    NetLink. If users need applications to run in a traditional
                    GUI environment, they can do so by re-linking to XVT's DSC
                    or DSC++ GUI libraries.</p>

                    that it is now shipping Essentials, Volume I, a library of
                    13 highly requested, native VCL components for Borland
                    Delphi and Borland C++Builder.</p>
               
               <p> Essentials includes controls commonly
                    found in popular shrink-wrap applications, but not available
                    to Delphi and C++Builder programmers. For example,
                    Essentials provides the ability to drop in a validated date
                    entry field with a drop-down calendar or a numeric entry
                    field with a drop-down calculator. Also included are menu
                    buttons, gradients, components for adding tiled bitmaps to a
                    form's background, and components for building "roll-up"
                    forms. Where appropriate, data-aware versions of these
                    components are also provided.</p>
               
               <p> Since Essentials includes native VCL
                    components, they compile directly into a Delphi or
                    C++Builder program.</p>
               
               <p> Essentials costs $69, with a 60-day,

               <p>KeyGen Corporation has released the
                    Beta version of its Automatic Synchronized KeyGenerator
                    (ASK) ToolKit . The ASK Toolkit provides a method of
                    generating rapidly changing, random, unpredictable
                    encryption keys and automatically synchronizing them at each
                    end of a communication link without transmitting the keys or
                    any information about the keys.</p>
               
               <p> The KeyGen system will work on all
                    digital or digitized data: voice, audio, video, text,
                    graphics, and binary code. Its speed is limited only by the
                    processor used, transmission method, and the encryption
                    algorithm. The ASK ToolKit used with symmetric key
                    encryption algorithms is much faster and more secure than
                    using the same algorithms alone (with seed strings), and
                    allows for additional features like intrusion detection.</p>

               <p>HyperAct has released WebApp 1.0, a
                    framework for Web-server applications development using
                    Delphi 2, Delphi 3, and C++ Builder. Applications developed
                    with WebApp 1.0 can run unmodified, without recompilation,
                    on top of any Web server. They are multithreaded, employing
                    thread pooling to maximize the utilization of the server
                    resources; run in a separate process from the server,
                    reducing the risk of a server crash; and can be debugged
                    easily from within the Delphi or C++Builder environment,
                    without requiring a restart of the server.</p>
               
               <p> The WebApp framework implements
                    transparent cookies-based, session-state management,
                    automatically tracking users. WebApp provides integrated
                    support for HTML templates, facilitating separation between
                    the application logic and the HTML Fronted.</p>
               
               <p> WebApp 1.0 costs $199 for the
                    Standard version, and $495 for the Pro version.</p>

               <p>Parity Software has announced
                    ChatterBocx/SAPI, a new feature of CallSuite that adds
                    text-to-speech capabilities to the product line. ChatterBocx
                    is an ActiveX control that can be used in Visual Basic,
                    Delphi, Visual C++, and other Windows languages.
                    Text-to-speech (TTS) technologies based on Microsoft's
                    Speech API (SAPI) are supported. ChatterBocx/SAPI can be
                    used to build both telephony applications based on VoiceBocx
                    control, and desktop applications that use multimedia
                    loudspeakers for speech output.</p>
               
               <p> The basic capability provided by
                    ChatterBocx/SAPI is to synthesize speech from text presented
                    as a string of ASCII characters, either in a text file or
                    from a string passed as an argument from program code. In a
                    telephony application, the speech is generated on a
                    telephone line and heard by the human caller; in a desktop
                    application the speech is generated through the
                    loudspeakers.</p>
