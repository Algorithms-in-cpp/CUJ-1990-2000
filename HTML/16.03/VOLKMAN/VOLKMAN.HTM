<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Introduction</FONT></H4>

<p>Since 1981, the mission of the C/C++ Users Group (CUG) has been committed to low-cost
distribution of shareware and freeware C/C++ source code. The CUG is an
independent organization sponsored by C/C++ Users Journal. CUG remains
impartial to compiler vendors and platforms. Currently, CUG focuses heavily on
cross-platform compatibility with Unix, Windows, and other platforms. You can
visit the CUG on the web at http://www.HAL9K.com/cug.<p>
The CUG CD-ROM is the primary vehicle by which the CUG organizes and
redistributes tools and libraries. One CD-ROM includes nearly 400 archives
covering the gamut of subjects from compilers to windowing systems. It also
includes a complete copy of the website for offline viewing, an HTML viewer,
Access 97 database indexes, and tech support information for each product
(where available).</p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">CUG in Print Again!</FONT></H4>

<p>After a hiatus of more than five years, CUG is back in print. On February 1 1998, CUG
and R&amp;D Technical Books launched a special book plus CD-ROM edition. The
book, now entitled C/C++ Treasure Chest: A Developer's Resource Kit of C/C++
Tools and Source Code (ISBN 0879305142) includes summaries and indexes of all
CUG archives. List price for the combined edition is only $39.95. In my five
years of stewardship I've shepherded more than 100 new archives of software
through CUG, but this is my proudest moment.</p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">What's New on the CUG CD-ROM</FONT></H4>

<p>This edition represents the single biggest installment to the CUG Library in its
17-year history. There is a greater emphasis on C++, though we haven't
forgotten our C roots. Here's a brief summary of the new titles:</p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">(CUG 467) LADsoft 32-bit ANSI C Compiler for 386 and M68k families</FONT></H4>

<p>David
Lindauer (Louisville, KY) submits his LADsoft C compiler, an optimizing
cross-compiler which can produce either Intel i386 or Motorola M68000 assembly
language output. The compiler contains optimizations and also has separate code
generation switches for M68000, M68010, and M68020 CPUs. The compiler
recognizes some C++ syntax as well, except for class declarations.<p>
LADsoft C strives to be ANSI-compatible at the source level. It may fall short
of requirements for evaluation ordering when casts are used. Also, floating
point is done purely using the math coprocessor, and is not adjusted for
ANSI/IEEE compatibility. The runtime library is designed to be ANSI-compatible.
The CUG distribution includes full source for compiler and library as well as
compiled executables. LADSoft C v1.35, released on 3/5/97, is now available on
the CUG CD-ROM.</p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">(CUG 468) Programmable Arbitrary Precision Calculator for Windows</FONT></H4>

<p>S. Jason Olasky (Rockville, MD) submits his Programmable Arbitrary Precision
Calculator for Windows (PAPCW). PAPCW is a reverse polish notation (RPN)
line-oriented calculator for Windows 3.1, 95, and NT. It includes financial and
date functions in addition to many standard mathematical functions. The
extended precision math routines utilize Judson D. McClendon's Bigcalc extended
precision library. Virtual arrays are used for the stack and memory registers,
so there are no effective limits on the stack size or number of registers.<p>
The stack is based on the FORTH model rather than the HP calculator model; the
stack expands and contracts as numbers are entered or result from operations on
numbers already on the stack. PAPCW programs use a hybrid notation combining
elements of the HP-41 and FORTH. Programs can be written using any ASCII
editor, or through a rudimentary built-in editor. Calculator dialogs facilitate
use of the financial and date functions. A registration fee of $35 is required
for use beyond the evaluation period. The CUG distribution includes full C
source code. PAPCW v1.1, as released on 12/7/96, is now available on the CUG
CD-ROM.</p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">(CUG 469) V: A Platform-independent GUI Library for C++</FONT></H4>

<p>Dr. Bruce E. Wampler (University of New Mexico, Albuquerque) releases V, a portable
C++ GUI Framework intended to support a wide variety of applications on
different graphical interface platforms. Applications developed using V will
have the look and feel of the native platform, yet will be portable across
platforms. Most standard GUI objects are supported by V, including windows with
menus, status bars, toolbars, and a drawing canvas; modal and modeless dialogs
with the most common controls; and portable printing support.<p>
V was originally written for use on X Windows and has since been ported to
Windows 3.1 and Win32 environments. The X Window implementation has been
validated on Linux, SunOS, and Alpha, and SGI machines. In Windows, it has been
built successfully with Borland, Watcom, and Microsoft VC++. OS/2 and Motif
ports are underway and should be completed soon. V is licensed under the GNU
Public License, which is intended to preserve its freeware status. The CUG
distribution includes separate archives for X Windows and Windows. V v1.16, as
released on 1/20/97, is now available on the CUG CD-ROM.</p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">(CUG 470) src2www/fm: Hypertext Index for Program Listings</FONT></H4>

<p>Michal Young (Purdue University) contributes a pair of packages for producing program
listings with hypertext indices. These packages do not automatically indent
code; a code formatting utility (such as GNU indent) or pretty-printing text
editor should be used prior to using src2www or src2fm. src2www produces HTML
versions of ANSI C and Ada code as well as simple C++ code. Building the
binaries requires Gnu make, Flex, and GCC from the Free Software Foundation.
Also, the scripts will need a recent version of gawk or nawk.<p>
src2fm shares the same front end, and therefore processes the same languages,
but produces FrameMaker documents. FrameMaker document colors and fonts can be
customized using style sheets, while customizing the HTML documents requires
editing a table compiled into the program. src2www and src2fm have been
implemented only on Unix systems. Young is willing to provide advice to those
attempting a port to non-Unix platforms. According to Young, "A good C
programmer should be able to add a driver for another output format, such as
RTF or LaTeX." src2www and src2fm are distributed as freeware. src2www v0.9g
and src2fm v0.9e are now available on the CUG CD-ROM.</p>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">(CUG 471) Beagle: Client/Server DBMS for Unix</FONT></H4>
<p>Robert Klein (Glen Burnie, MD) submits Beagle, an SQL-based client/server
relational DBMS. Currently, Beagle supports a wide variety of Unix platforms
including: Linux 2.0.14, SCO Openserver, FreeBSD 2.1R, SGI IRIX v5.3, Solaris
v2.x, and HP/UX. The current version also supports OS/2, and porting projects
are underway for Windows 95, NT, and other platforms. A support mailing list is
available, too.<p>
Beagle's features are accessible primarily through its C-callable API. Its
client/server implementation works using BSD-style sockets for communication.
Most of the recent development has centered around implementing BTree indices
and seeing that they are properly applied in SELECT, DELETE, and other SQL
statements. Beagle DBMS, released on 4/3/97, is now available on the CUG CD-ROM.</p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">(CUG 472) HELIOS: Radiosity (photorealistic) Renderer for Windows</FONT></H4>

<p>Ian
Ashdown (West Vancouver, BC) releases HELIOS, a radiosity renderer for Windows.
Radiosity is the name used by the computer graphics community to describe
radiative flux transfer techniques. Radiosity methods are extremely useful in
developing advanced lighting simulation and visualization software for
architectural design and illumination engineering applications.  Radiosity is,
in a sense, the complement of ray tracing. Ray-tracing techniques excel in the
rendition of point light sources, specular reflections, and refraction effects.
Radiosity methods accurately model area light sources, diffuse reflections,
color bleeding effects, and realistic shadows.<p>
Ashdown wrote HELIOS as an integral part of his book Radiosity: A Programmer's
Perspective, (ISBN 0-471-30488-3). The HELIOS source code is copyrighted, but
freely available for personal, non-commercial uses. The CUG distribution of
HELIOS includes complete C++ source code and executables for a fully functional
radiosity renderer that runs under Windows 3.1, 95, and NT. Helios v1.03,
released 4/1/96, is now available on the CUG CD-ROM.</p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">(CUG 473) HotKey: Windows 95-style taskbar for Windows 3.1</FONT></H4>

<p>Hao
Liang (Zongshan, People's Republic of China) contributes HotKey, a Windows
95-style taskbar for Windows 3.1. HotKey can be used by itself or can coexist
with PCTools for Windows desktop (by Central Point Software). In addition to
organizing tasks and their icons, HotKey includes a popup zoom window (F12 key
toggles), RGB value display (F11 key), and absolute position display wherever
the mouse cursor roams.<p>
HotKey was written using Borland C++ 4.5. Rather than using MFC or OWL, Liang
created his own lightweight GUI framework. HotKey also includes a copy of John
Webster Small's popular container_lite, a portable container library for C++.
The CUG Library distribution of HotKey includes full C++ source and
executables. HotKey, released on 1/17/97, is now available on the CUG CD-ROM.</p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">(CUG 474A) The X Games</FONT></H4>

<p>Matt
Chapman (Bournemouth, England) submits a trio of games for the X Windows
environment: XScrabble, XCountdown, and XBikes. XScrabble was co-written with
Matthew Badham. The programs also incorporate Xc, the Control Panel Widget Set
v1.3, by Paul D. Johnston. Chapman has granted permission for these programs to
be freely copied and distributed by any means, provided that his copyright
notices remain unchanged. He reserves the right to be identified as the author.</p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">(CUG 474A) X Games: Multiplayer Scrabble with 114K Words</FONT></H4>

<p>XScrabble is a full multiplayer (1-4) implementation of the classic board game, with
multilevel computer players, an over 118,000-word dictionary (the Official
Scrabble Players Dictionary, edition 3, as used in U.S. tournaments). There is
a high-score table, a best single goes list, a handy setup window, and
load/save facilities. XScrabble should work in most X Window environments,
including SunOS 5.1, AIX, and Linux. The CUG Library distribution includes full
source code in C. XScrabble v1.00, released on 3/12/97, is now available on the
CUG CD-ROM.</p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">(CUG 474B) X Games: Countdown UK Quiz Show Game</FONT></H4>

<p>Countdown is a daily British quiz show involving word games and number games. Xcountdown
is a two-player implementation of Countdown for the X Window System. Each
player has their own game window on their own display. The included OSPD
(Official Scrabble Players Dictionary, v2 &#151; all words up to nine letters) is
used for the word games. Various algorithms are used to show the best possible
score for each game, after the players have attempted it. XCountdown also
contains some pictures of Carol Vorderman, who is featured on the show.
XCountdown should work in most X Window environments, including SunOS 5.1, AIX,
and Linux. The CUG Library distribution includes full source code in C.
XCountdown v1.00, released on 2/12/97, is now available on the CUG CD-ROM.</p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">(CUG 474C) X Games: Lightcycles Game for 2-6 Players over the Internet</FONT></H4>

<p>XBikes is a very simple lightcycles game for 2 to 6 players. The lightcycles game idea
was first popularized by the movie Tron. BSD sockets are used for client/server
communications so each player can play from their own X console. Each player
controls a "bike," which keeps moving until it hits something, while leaving a
trail behind it. Your path must not intersect another player's path, your path,
or the playing field walls. The sooner you crash, the more points you lose. The
last player still moving is declared the winner. XBikes requires an X Window
environment, and only Solaris is currently supported. The CUG Library
distribution includes full source code in C. XBikes v1.00, released on 2/12/97,
is now available on the CUG CD-ROM.</p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">(CUG 475) ThinAir: Pseudo-random Number Generator in C++</FONT></H4>

<p>G.
Wade Johnson (Houston, TX) contributes ThinAir, a C++ class library providing
an abstract interface to pseudo-random number sequence generator (PRNG)
classes. The library is distributed as source and documentation for over 40
PRNGs, including algorithms by Knuth, Borosh-Niederreiter, Waterman,
Lavaux-Janssense, and Marsaglia.<p>
ThinAir is designed to take the guesswork out of using PRNGs. Unfortunately,
most PRNGs available to the average programmer are not very good. Usually it's
not easy to learn which generator is provided. This makes finding the
weaknesses or problems with a particular generator almost impossible. Even if
you realize the potential problems with a provided generator, you usually don't
know how to go about testing and verifying another PRNG. ThinAir allows you to
take control of which PRNG you want to get the quality and integrity you
need.<p>
The CUG Library distribution includes makefiles for VC++, Borland C++, and GNU
C++. ThinAir features a rand() interface, function object interface, ability to
save and restore state on a generator, and the ability to clone a generator.
ThinAir is released as freeware. Although Johnson retains copyright to the
source, there are no restrictions on using it in your applications. ThinAir
v0.9B, released on 2/20/97, is now available on the CUG CD-ROM.</p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">(CUG 476) Amulet: Portable C++ GUI Application Framework</FONT></H4>

<p>Brad
A. Myers of the User Interface Software Group in the Human Computer Interaction
Institute at Carnegie Mellon University submits Amulet. Amulet is a user
interface development environment for C++ and is portable across X11 on all
kinds of Unix (Sun, Dec, HP, SGI, Linux, NetBSD, etc.), Windows 95 and NT (with
VC++), and the Macintosh. Amulet helps you create graphical, interactive user
interfaces for your software.<p>
More than just another free virtual toolkit, Amulet includes many features
specifically designed to make the creation of highly interactive, graphical,
direct-manipulation user interfaces significantly easier, including: a
prototype-instance object model; constraints; high-level input handling,
including automatic undo, built-in support for animation, and
gesture-recognition; and a full set of widgets. Amulet is the successor to
Garnet, an earlier CMU project you may be familiar with. Amulet v3.0 is now
available on the CUG CD-ROM.</p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">(CUG 477) Using C++ and Fortran: Tutorial on Mixed Languages</FONT></H4>

<p>Carsten Arnholm (Heggedal, Norway) has contributed his paper "Portable Mixed Language
Programming Using C++ and FORTRAN" and accompanying class libraries. This
treatise considers how to best encapsulate calling FORTRAN libraries from the
C++ environment in both Windows and Unix platforms. Arnholm notes that 40 years
of legacy FORTRAN code and its maintenance should and must continue to be used
in many cases. He sets forth rigorous guidelines for mixed-language
integration:</p>
<UL><LI>The C++/FORTRAN programs must be as portable as their FORTRAN-only
        ancestors.</LI>
    <LI>A single source code must be used on all platforms.</LI>
    <LI>Calling FORTRAN from C++ must be easy and straightforward. It must not be
        significantly more difficult to call FORTRAN from C++ than calling it from
        FORTRAN itself.</LI>
    <LI>Mixed C++/FORTRAN must not induce any significant performance penalty.</LI>
    <LI>All major FORTRAN features must be supported from C++.</LI>
    <LI>Calling FORTRAN from C++ shall be done without changing the FORTRAN code,
        which has been tested and verified.</LI>
</UL>
<p>Arnholm's package consists of the 30-page paper (.wri file), fortran.h
macros, and character, complex, and fmatrix compatibility classes. Version 1.1,
released on 5/28/97, is now available on the CUG CD-ROM.</p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">(CUG 478) FreeDOS: 16-bit MS-DOS Replacement with Sources</FONT></H4>

<p>Morgan Toal (Barrow, AK) releases FreeDOS, a completely free MS-DOS-compatible
operating system. FreeDOS will run on all DOS-capable platforms, from XTs to
Pentium Pros. FreeDOS is a complete standalone operating system. It includes a
kernel, shell (command.com replacement), and a full complement of utilities
from ATTRIB to XCOPY. FreeDOS uses a freeware C compiler for all development
work. The FreeDOS mission is to allow hobbyists, hackers, and anyone who would
enjoy a chance to examine or customize the source code and inner workings of a
real operating system for educational, practical, or recreational purposes.
FreeDOS is compatible with MS-DOS v3.30.<p>
FreeDOS and its associated programs and documentation are protected under the
terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). All copyrights are retained by
the original authors. All source code will be publicly available. FreeDOS
v0.92.0, released 2/7/97, can now be found on the CUG CD-ROM.</p>
