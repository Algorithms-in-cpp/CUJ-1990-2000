<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Crossware Releases Try-Before-You-Buy C Compilers</FONT></H4>

<p>Crossware has introduced fully functional try-before-you-buy versions of its Windows
95/NT 4.0 C compilers. The 8051 C compiler includes smart pointers and
cross-module type checking.<p>
In response to customer demand, developers can now download the package of
their choice from the Internet (www.crossware.com) 24 hours per day, 7 days per
week. After installation, the developer reconnects to the Crossware website,
where an automated system supplies a code to activate the package. Crossware is
providing comprehensive support during the evaluation period. It has installed
the latest web-conferencing software so that all users can ask questions,
interact, and get the best from their embedded development software. Crosswise
claims that with hundreds of new users simultaneously evaluating the Crossware
packages, the web-conference approach is an effective support solution.<p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Mutek Announces BugTrapper</FONT></H4>

<p>Mutek
Solutions, Ltd. has announced BugTrapper, a product that automatically tracks
running applications and identifies irreproducible bugs at remote customer
sites. BugTrapper tracks irreproducible bugs in large programs, Internet
applets, or time-dependent and multiprocessing applications.<p>
BugTrapper records problematic buggy scenarios so they can be fixed. It tracks
and logs everything that happens inside the program's code during the time
prior to the bug's appearance, eliminating the need to reproduce the problem.
This tracing information, somewhat like a "source-code movie," includes all
information needed to analyze the bug. Once the execution has been recorded,
analysis and debugging can be performed off-line with this recorded scenario,
using standard debugging operations.<p>
To solve a problem at a customer site, the compact BugTrapperAgent utility can
be sent instead of a developer to record a problematic execution. The resulting
log can be used to analyze and solve the problem.<p>
BugTrapper costs $5,000 for the first copy, and $1,000 for each additional
copy. The BugTrapperAgent costs $750, or $23,750 for a package of 25. Quantity
discounts are available.<p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">ViaTech Introduces VT Protect 5.0</FONT></H4>

<p>ViaTech
Inc. has announced VT Protect 5.0, the latest version of its software-based,
anti-piracy product. VT Protect 5.0 introduces an adaptive fingerprint
technology that provides a secure, node-locked licensing solution. Based on
developer requirements, a balanced level of flexible license compliance can be
enacted. In addition, VT Protect 5.0 includes a secure clock anti-tampering
mechanism.<p>
VT Protect features a "multi-pass" encryption scheme. This method gathers a
piece of system or hardware information (i.e. IP address, operating system
information, BIOS ID) and scrambles it, then gathers a second piece of
information and scrambles it with the first, then finds a third piece of
information and combines that with the first two, and so on until it creates an
identifier completely unique to the system.<p>
VT Protect 5.0 costs between $800-$1,000 for administration tools and an
initial 100 keys. Volume-based pricing is available for additional keys.<p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Cygnus Releases GNUPro Toolkit 97r2 Supporting Embedded C++</FONT></H4>

<p>Cygnus
Solutions has announced GNUPro Toolkit 97r2, which includes Embedded C++ (EC++)
support. GNUPro Toolkit 97r2 includes C++ support for member templates and
improved exception handling, adding more powerful C++ language attributes.<p>
EC++ in Cygnus' GNUPro Toolkit 97r2 is implemented as an option enabled during
program compilation. The compiler searches the code for certain restricted
features of C++ and flags their presence to the developer as warnings or hard
errors if desired. The developer can eliminate these features to make the code
compliant with the EC++ specification and in doing so, will potentially
decrease code size and memory needs and increase the run-time efficiency.
Cygnus gives the developer the option to issue hard errors instead of warnings
for the use of restricted features, allowing progression through the design
cycle with warnings initially, and hard errors during the final phases. Cygnus'
implementation of EC++ allows programmers to develop code without the need to
work around known EC++ violations, thus increasing productivity and decreasing
time-to-market.<p>
Pricing for GNUPro 97r2 starts at $7,495 for native tools and $9,995 for
embedded tools, and includes the toolkit and a one-year support contract for up
to five developers.<p>
