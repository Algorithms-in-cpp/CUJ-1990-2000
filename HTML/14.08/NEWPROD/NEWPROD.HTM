                NewCode Technology Announces Embedded C++ Interpreter</FONT></H4>
               
               <p>NewCode Technology Inc. has announced
                    the release of its embeddable C++ interpreter, NCi. The
                    company has also made a free version of the interpreter
                    available for preliminary evaluation.</p>
               
               <p>NCi is a standards-compliant C++
                    interpreter designed to be embedded in end-user
                    applications. NCi becomes a run-time component of an
                    application, allowing application developers to provide
                    end-users with the ability to dynamically extend
                    functionality in their C++ products. As a result, code can
                    be reused, new behavior is added more easily, the
                    architecture of distributed C++ applications is simplified,
                    and the useful life of the product is extended.</p>
               
               <p>NCi allows interpreted code to call
                    compiled code with full type checking. It also allows new
                    variables, functions, and types (including subclasses) to be
                    created at run time. In addition, it ensures proper
                    interaction between all interpreted code and compiled code.</p>
               
               <p>NCi is currently available on HP-UX
                    and Solaris. Pricing ranges from under $100 to $1,500,
                    depending on volume. For preliminary evaluation, the
                    interpreter can be downloaded via FTP on the Internet.</p>

               <p>Blue Sky Software has released Visual
                    SQL. Visual SQL extends Visual C++ with visual designers,
                    intuitive wizards, and object-oriented data access, creating
                    a visual and client/server development environment without
                    leaving Microsoft Visual C++s familiar environment. Visual
                    SQL integrates seamlessly with Microsoft Developer Studio
                    and is designed for developers who want to rapidly develop 
                    robust, scaleable high-performance C++ client/server

                    access to all database objects from a central component
                    repository. Visual SQL is based on the industry standard C++
                    object-oriented language and builds on the power of the 
                    32-bit Visual C++ native code compiler.</p>

                    Open Class Library, a library of prebuilt components that
                    can be assembled into portable applications. The library
                    incorporates the compound-document framework technology from
                    Taligent. Frameworks provide a structure for reusing
                    application designs and code built from predefined objects. 
                    Taligents Compound Document Framework (CDF) simplifies
                    Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) programming by enabling
                    creation of OLE applications with as few as two or three
                    lines of code. CDF represents a collaboration among IBM,
                    Taligent, and Lotus Development Corporation. Lotus
                    technology facilitates interaction with the OLE interface.</p>

                TGS Announces VRML ActiveX Control for Internet Explorer 3.0</FONT></H4>
               
               <p>Template Graphics Software (TGS) has
                    announced a 3-D graphics ActiveX control for Microsoft
                    Internet Explorer 3.0. The 3Space Explorer control includes
                    file support for VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language),
                    Silicon Graphics Open Inventor, and Autodesk DXF. The
                    control enables interactive 3-D content to be easily
                    incorporated into home pages on the World Wide Web. The 
                    control differs from other embedded VRML support approaches,
                    such as browser plug-ins, in that it is fully programmable
                    through the use of VBScript and JavaScript. This
                    programmability enables construction of 3-D objects into the
                    front-end of applications and then deployment of the
                    applications as web pages.</p>
               
               <p>Cost for 3Space Explorer is $150.</p>

               <p>Hurricane Software has released Source
                    Gen PRO, a tool for creating source code for dialogs that
                    can be displayed in Windows 3.1, and WinGREP, a multi-file
                    search utility that locates text strings in source code
                    files.</p>
               
               <p>Source Gen PRO can create response
                    handlers for window messages and notifications, and can
                    subclass controls. The source code generation templates are
                    fully customizable, allowing the code to be generated to fit
                    the users needs. WinGREP displays the results of a search in
                    a programmers native working environment. WinGREP can be
                    customized to automatically synchronize an editor or IDE 
                    with the results of a search. Not only does it open the
                    file, but it will also position to the line of the match.</p>
               
               <p>You can download trial versions of

               <p>ObjectSoftware Inc. has announced
                    Release 1.5 of ObjectManual, a software tool to generate
                    HTML format documentation from C++ programs. ObjectManual
                    incorporates the use of JAVA and HTML to generate
                    hyperlinked documentation.</p>
               
               <p>ObjectManual helps automate the
                    generation of HTML documents from C++ programs. Software
                    written in C++ is made up of data structures. In C++, a
                    class represents a data structure and is made up of methods
                    and data. ObjectManual analyzes C++ classes and generates
                    their documentation. The documentation is generated in
                    HyperText Markup Language (HTML) format. The generated 
                    documentation can be viewed by HTML browsers and editors.
                    Along with the documentation, Release 1.5 of ObjectManual
                    generates applet tags in the HTML documentation. These tags
                    are interpreted by Java enabled browsers to draw C++ class
                    hierarchies, method hierarchies and various other class
                    related information.</p>
               
               <p>ObjectManual Release 1.5 is available
                    for SPARC SunOS 4.l.X, SPARC Solaris 2.X, x86 Solaris 2.4
                    architectures, and Windows NT. Single license price for
                    SPARC architecture starts from $2,895. Single license price
