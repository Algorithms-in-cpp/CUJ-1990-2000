<BLOCKQUOTE>

The process of converting between Cartesian and quadcode representations is surprisingly simple, thanks to the conversion algorithm devised by Gargantini. Consider the quadcode 23 in <A href="fig2.htm">Figure 2</a>.
 It is located in row 3, column 1 (using zero-based row and column numbers). The row and column numbers, in binary, are:<P>
<pre>I = 11
J = 01</pre>
If the individual bits are named, with bit 0 the least-significant one, we have:<P>
<pre>I0 = 1, I1 = 1, J0 = 1, J1 = 0</pre>
Next these two binary numbers are combined by alternately taking bits from the <I>I</I> and <I>J</I> coordinates. Specifically, we will use the bits in this order:<P>
<pre>I1, J1, I0, J0</pre>
where I have shown them in left-to-right order. The result is:<P>
<pre>Q = 1011</pre>
This is actually the binary representation of the quadcode 23! The two highest-order bits (10) are the 2, and the lowest-order bits (11) are the 3.<P>
To use a little more complicated example, consider the quadcode <I>A</I> in <A href="fig3.htm">Figure 3</a>,
 which has a value of 213 and has (<I>I,J</I>) coordinates of (5,3). Expressed in binary, the coordinates are:<P>
<pre>I = 101
J = 011</pre>
which corresponds to:<P>
<pre>I0 = 1, I1 = 0, I2 = 1, J0 = 1, J1 = 1, J2 = 0</pre>
Now combine these two sets of bits in order<P>
<pre>I2, J2, I1, J1, I0, J0</pre>
to get:<P>
<pre>Q = 100111</pre>
By considering each group of two bits to be one quit, the result is 2 (10), 1 (01), and 3 (11).<P>
Actually, since I have chosen to zero-pad any extra bits in the byte, the actual storage would be:<P>
<pre>Q = 10011100</pre>
This makes it very easy to compare one quadcode to another for purposes of ordering. <I>QuadCode::Compare </I>does this by comparing each byte of two quadcodes, starting with the first and working left-to-right.<P>
