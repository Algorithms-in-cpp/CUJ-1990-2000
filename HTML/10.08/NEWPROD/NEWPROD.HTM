<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01A3_00D4">Reasoning Systems Announces Reengineering Product for C<A name="01A3_00D4"></FONT></h4></P>
Reasoning Systems announced REFINE/C, a customizable reengineering tool for programs written in C, that contributes to understanding, evaluating, modifying, and redocumenting existing C programs. REFINE/C reads C source and produces structure charts, data flow diagrams, variable tables, function tables, type tables, and coding-standards violation reports. Reports can be viewed online using an X-Window based interface or printed on PostScript printers. REFINE/C can export information to the Software through Pictures CASE tool. REFINE/C has been used to analyze programs with over 100,000 lines of code and supports both ANSI and K&amp;R C.<P>
Reasoning Systems produces the REFINE Language Tools family, that includes REFINE/FORTRAN and REFINE/COBOL. REFINE/C is not restricted to a fixed set of reengineering tools, since it includes a "reengineering API" that allows users to customize reengineering capabilities. Early users have developed customizations for optimizing existing C code for execution on a parallel processor and for translating from a proprietary language to C.<P>
REFINE/C v1.0 is available on Sun and IBM UNIX workstations. Single license pricing is $4,900. For further information, <I>contact Reasoning Systems, 3260 Hillview Ave., Palo Alto, CA 94304, (415) 494-6201; FAX: (415) 494-8053</I>.<P>
