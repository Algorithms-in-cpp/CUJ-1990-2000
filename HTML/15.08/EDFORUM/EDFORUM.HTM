               <p> I've discovered that modern operating
                    systems rust. I know I'm spoiled by all those years running
                    Unix. The system would stay up for weeks at a time. It would
                    stumble on with the most horribly damaged filesystems. It
                    would run with all disks 95 per cent full for years at a
                    time. You can't say the same of Windows 95 or Windows NT.
                    </p>
               
               <p>I just spent most of the past month
                    resurrecting Bugs Bunny, the Gateway laptop that's been at
                    the center of my professional existence for the past year
                    and a half. I don't think it was a carrot that got stuck in
                    his craw. More likely, it was a Xircom PC card whose drivers
                    wouldn't quite install &#151; and wouldn't quite uninstall
                    either. It could have been an inopportune power blip too,
                    but I'll never know. In any event, Bugs started crashing one
                    day every time I started up Microsoft's Internet Explorer.
                    And he never got over that habit. </p>
               
               <p> I tried reinstalling Internet
                    Explorer. Then I tried one of those Windows registry
                    editors, which pokes at the compost heap of centralized
                    information buried deep inside every Windows system. If
                    anything, I lost ground. For a while, Windows 95 would crash
                    while booting up &#151; a scary experience, I can testify, when
                    all your work is held prisoner on an inaccessible disk. I
                    even tried reinstalling Windows 95, but it helpfully
                    preserved the source of all my problems. </p>
               
               <p> In the end, I had to use Bugs's twin,
                    Tazzy Devil as a kind of lifeboat. In an elaborate and
                    perilous series of maneuvers, I sloshed data back and forth
                    between the two computers while I rebuilt everything in
                    sight. Both machines ended up with reformatted disks and
                    rejuvenated operating systems. </p>
               
               <p> I don't want to count the hours I
                    spent on this exercise. But it did make me aware of the
                    general decay of all the systems on my LAN (except the two
                    Unix boxes, that is). I now see that the Windows NT
                    workstation and the other Windows 95 machines also need
                    dusting and cleaning. They've all seen too many huge
                    compilers come and go, not to mention other products that
                    leave dust and dirt behind. </p>
               
               <p> Next year, I'll up the time I budget
                    for systems maintenance. </p>
