               <p>Interactive Network Technologies, Inc.
                    (INT) has released Carnac v1.1, its 2-D graphics toolkit.
                    New features include two Software Developers' Kits: the
                    Flavors SDK and Dynamic Scenes SDK. The Flavors SDK
                    simplifies the production of User-Defined Primitives
                    (complex shapes), while the Dynamic Scenes SDK assists with
                    producing the code for the generation of dynamic scenes on
                    the fly. In addition, support for 1-, 8-, and 24-bit
                    rotatable, shearable, and scalable images with full
                    transparency control has been added. This extends the number
                    of classes of objects that can be manipulated and displayed
                    either statically or dynamically with real-time, movie-type
                    performance available. Finally, a CGM output option has been
                    added to the existing options. </p>
               
               <p> Carnac is available for Windows 95,
                    Windows NT, and most common UNIX/X-Window implementations.
                    INT also provides a full support package, including a
                    product update service, technical support hotline, and
                    training for all its products. </p>

               <p>DeltaLogic has released the Extended
                    Template Library (XTL) for Win32, an enhanced implementation
                    of the standard C++ library. XTL container classes employ an
                    exception-safe design pattern that eliminates template code
                    bloat, supports multi-threaded programming, and encourages
                    the use of polymorphism. Each container type provides smart
                    iterators that reduce the most common iterator programming
                    errors. XTL allocators have a public interface that lets the
                    containers have per-instance private pools of memory, a
                    feature not available with any other standard library
                    implementation. </p>
               
               <p> XTL supplies extended versions of the
                    standard iostreams and string classes that have many useful
                    operations not provided for by the C++ Standard, such as
                    case-insensitive searching and comparison, and search-based
                    substring replacement. </p>
               
               <p> XTL costs $795 for a single-user
                    license; quantity and educational discounts are available.

               <p>TracePoint Technology has announced
                    HiProf, which supports Microsoft's Visual Studio 97.
                    HiProf's hierarchical profiling enables developers to
                    conduct code analysis on the binaries of 32-bit C and C++
                    Windows applications. Hierarchical profiling shows each
                    function's self-time, as well as the number of calls taking
                    place between all parent and child functions and the time
                    that activity takes. </p>
               
               <p> HiProf is based on a patented Binary
                    Code Instrumentation (BCI) technology developed by Digital's
                    Western Research Lab. HiProf enables developers to
                    selectively exclude DLLs or portions of their EXE file from
                    profiling in order to drill down on specific portions of an
                    application, or to evaluate third-party components. </p>
               
               <p> Suggested retail for HiProf is $599;
                    a free trial version is also available for download from

                    or the Internet, and interact live with a common software
                    design.</p>
               
               <p>In addition, GDPro supports the
                    process of reverse engineering, or generating source code
                    and making changes to that code without using code markers.
                    Other features include support for the UML methodology and
                    the ability to automatically turn existing source code or
                    diagrams into HTML documents ready for publication on the

               <p>Rogue Wave Software, Inc. has
                    announced two products that support C++/Java
                    interoperability. Serialize.h++ 1.0, a C++ class library,
                    uses the Java serialization mechanism in Sun's JDK 1.1 to
                    exchange objects and data with Java programs, eliminating
                    the need for native calls to the C++ code. JTools 2.0 uses
                    the serialization format of Rogue Wave's Tools.h++ to
                    exchange data with C++ applications, minimizing the need for
                    any modification on the C++ side. </p>
               
               <p> Serialize.h++ 1.0 is available only
                    in the source code version and costs $995 for a single-user
                    license. Annual support contracts are $395 each. JTools 2.0
                    costs $495 for a single-user license of the byte code
                    version; a source code version is also available. Annual
                    support contracts are $195 each. Multi-user licenses are
                    available for both. </p>

               <p>ParaSoft Corporation has announced
                    that CodeWizard vl.0 now supports Microsoft's Visual C++
                    v5.0. CodeWizard is a C++ source code analysis tool. For a
                    limited time, anyone can download a copy of this product at
                    no charge from ParaSoft's web site
                    (http://www.parasoft.com). </p>
               
               <p> Based on Scott Meyers' book,
                    Effective C++, CodeWizard finds errors by checking the
                    program for any violations according to Meyers' rules and
                    printing any error messages in the Developer's Studio. Then
                    CodeWizard passes the code to the Visual C++ compiler to
                    generate the object code. Since CodeWizard is tightly
                    integrated with Visual C++, everything can be done in one
                    pass and no additional steps are required in the build
                    cycle. </p>

               <p>Amzi! Inc. has announced the 4.0
                    release of Amzi! Prolog + Logic Server. Amzi! Logic Server
                    (Prolog engine) has been redesigned as a native C++

                    separate threads. It also provides for seamless integration
                    of Prolog's catch/throw mechanism to the catch/throw
                    mechanisms in C++, Java, and Delphi. </p>
               
               <p> Support for Internet and Web-based
