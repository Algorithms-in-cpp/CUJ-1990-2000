               <p>Microsoft's recently released ActiveX
                    toolkit includes the Microsoft Internet SDK (a.k.a inetsdk).
                    The WININET Win32 toolkit provides a convenient API to
                    internet protocols, including Gopher, FTP, and HTTP, without
                    the need to include any Windows sockets code or TCP/IP
                    management code. In this article, I briefly describe how to
                    use the Win32 Internet API to open a simple HTTP connection
                    and retrieve a web page.</p>
               
               <h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Retrieving a Web Page</FONT></H4>
               
               <p>The Win32 Internet functions enable
                    your application to easily retrieve pages from an Internet
                    server. After including the right headers and libraries in
                    your project, you can add a class to do HTTP retrievals.
                    <A href="table1.htm">Table 1</a>
lists some of the basic
                    Internet HTTP functions available. I've written a simple
                    class using these functions to handle all of the internet
                    communication (<A href="list1.htm">Listing 1</a>)
. 
                    </p>
               
               <p> CInternetClass's constructor takes
                    care of all of the initialization required for the Win32
                    Internet functions. CInternetClass::GetUrl takes a complete
                    URL passed in as a string, extracts the server and path, and
                    does all that is necessary to retrieve the page. It returns
                    the text in a buffer passed in by the caller. GetUrl calls
                    the Win32 Internet function InternetOpenUrl to open the
                    specified URL. InternetOpenUrl does all the necessary string
                    parsing to find the server, connect to the server, and open
                    the correct kind of connection. You can use the
                    InternetConnect and HttpOpenRequest functions to accomplish
                    the same thing, but using InternetOpenUrl simplifies the
                    process greatly. InternetReadFile is the function that
                    actually reads the data in any mode of operation. Finally,
                    InternetCloseHandle is used to close the connection. The
                    amount of code is trivial, and advanced functions such as
                    proxy server support are transparent except for the setup.</p>
               
               <h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Installation and
               Support</FONT></H4>
               
               <p>Microsoft currently ships The Win32
                    Internet functions as part of the ActiveX toolkit. The
                    Internet functions are installed by Microsoft Internet
                    Explorer, or through a separate install package. Microsoft
                    will be including these functions as part of future Windows
                    operating systems. You can find more information about the
                    ActiveX toolkit at
                    http://www.microsoft.com/activeplatform/default.ASP</p>
               
               <h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Conclusion</FONT></H4>
               
               <p>The Microsoft Internet SDK provides a
                    convenient and easy way to integrate your applications with
                    the Internet, without requiring lots of time writing
                    low-level Windows Sockets code or TCP/IP transactions. By
                    leveraging Microsoft's API, you can avoid rewriting and
                    debugging code, and easily link your application to the
                    Internet. o </p>
