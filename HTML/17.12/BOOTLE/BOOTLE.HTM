<p>Never one to rush a good cataclysm, Stan weighs in at the midnight hour with his own take on Y2K.</p>

<p>I had resolved not to bore you with my spin on the Y2K saga. Yet, as the clock of Damocles ticks on, I thought I should throw my ancient hat in the ring before the world ends and every known computer column collapses. Composing a potentially final <I>Abschied</I> helps mightily to focus the mind. After all, literally, the so-called Y2K "bug" is the fault of EOFs (Extremely Old Farts) such as <I>moi</I> who were recklessly conserving bytes back in the 1950s. Even earlier, in fact, as I'm fond of telling my gullible clients: "Fear not," sez I, "we coped with the 1899-18100 transition." (Yes, Hollerith cards had diverse X-Y overpunchings and some even offered a col-81). Some are blaming COBOL for the default [19]yy format, yet programs written in contemporaneous languages such as APL also took the millennial-unaware route <a href="#1">[1]</a>. What I can assert is that way back in the [19]50/60s many of our applications were unavoidably involved with [20]yy dates. For example, insurance companies were among the first to computerize, and policy-expiration dates and actuarial tables oft went beyond 12/31/1999. (Quick diversion: an actuary is a statistician who wants you to die on time.)</p>
<p>However, as you've been reading <I>ad nauseam,</I> certain clock chip odometers will flip from 99 to 00 with no overflow warning, and many naive programs, not mine, will default to an off-by-one-century, 1900. Not so bad, really, as one-off errors go, until you reach 1914 when the century went irretrievably rotten <a href="#2">[2]</a>. The bright side, often overlooked, is that telephone calls spanning 12/31/1999 and 01/01/2000 will result in large negative on-line connect times with huge credits on your AT&amp;T bill. Similarly, Miss Otis will regret that the elevator has not been serviced for an unsigned 68K years &#151; an obvious fail-safe situation.</p>
<p>Kevin G. Barkes, who hosts the most mis-hit website (<B>www.kgb.com</B> <a href="#3">[3]</a>), has an infallible Y2K solution. You simply buy ($20) and wear his KGB Y2K Beanie&#153;. Given the probability of being zapped by a Y2K problem, the probability of such while you are improbably wearing the Beanie is...I leave the multiplication to you and Bayes. You may recognize an earlier, less advisable variant: always carry a bomb when you board a plane!</p>
<p>Sneak-Preview: My Feb'00 Column (if such there be):</p>
<p>I've been working on the next-big-hyped, truly portable language. It's a sort of Java/Common Lisp m&eacute;lange retaining the syntactic simplicity of C++ and Algol68. The temp in-house designation is BALSA but my Indonesian Xerox marketing colleagues prefer TIMOR.</p>
