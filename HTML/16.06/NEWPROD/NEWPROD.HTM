<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Geodesic Releases Great Circle v3.1</FONT></H4>

<p>Geodesic Systems has released Great Circle v3.1, a C/C++ debugger and memory manager for
Windows NT/95. With the addition of an HTML-based GUI, Great Circle allows
off-site development teams to monitor memory performance and remotely debug
applications. The new interface also includes features such as detailed
reporting statistics and reduced memory requirements. As with previous
versions, Great Circle v3.1 continues to use garbage collection technology to
debug and automatically manage an application's memory.  Great Circle is a
collection of C and C++ debugging libraries that use garbage collection
technology to automatically find and eliminate memory leaks and premature frees
in application specific code, third party components, and legacy code. Unlike
conventional debuggers, Great Circle can be used both as a debugging tool and
as a linked library that automatically protects deployed software applications
against memory bugs that may arise in the field. By analyzing, managing, and
freeing memory during run time, Great Circle frees the programmer from
time-consuming and error-prone manual memory management.<p>
Great Circle v3.1 for Windows 95/NT supports Microsoft Visual C++ v4.x and
v5.0. It costs $695 per user license and includes 90 days of free support.<p>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">On Time Introduces RTFiles-16 and RTFiles-32</FONT></H4>

<p>On
Time has released RTFiles, a FAT file system for embedded systems running on an
operating system that does not provide file I/O support. RTFiles is delivered
with all device drivers that are required to create, read, write, etc. files on
commonly used hard and floppy disks and flash and IDE devices. RTFiles supports
FAT12 and FAT16 formats.<p>
Two different versions of RTFiles are available: RTFiles-16 is intended for
16-bit embedded systems running in real mode on x86-compatible CPUs. Intel 8088
and higher CPUs are supported. RTFiles-32 runs in 32-bit protected mode (flat
address memory model) on Intel 386 or higher compatible CPUs.<p>
RTFiles consists of a library that can be linked to embedded systems programs.
The library contains the core file-handling functions, as well as the required
device drivers. It offers four different APIs: the native RTFiles API, the C++
API (iostream class library), ANSI C FILE stream library, and operating system
emulation APIs (DOS-compatible for RTFiles-16, Win32-compatible for
RTFiles-32). Most applications using file I/O can run without source-code
modifications under RTFiles.<p>
RTFiles costs $1,700. Complete source code is available at an extra cost of
$1,500.<p>
