<P><i><A name="00F9_0000"><A name="00F9_0000">Stan Kelly-Bootle has written the "Devil's Advocate" column in UNIX Review since 1984. He is the author of 12 books including The Devil's DP Dictionary, Mastering Turbo C, and, just out from SYBEX, Understanding UNIX Stan has judged the Bad C Pun contest since its debut.</i></P><P>
There are those who consider the pun to be the lowest form of wit; indeed some consider <I>bad pun</I> to be a tautology. Yet such is the subtlety of Homo risibilus that much merriment can be extracted from really atrocious jokes and puns. The Annual <I>C Users Journal</I> Bad C Pun Contest is based on this premise and each year the entries have grown both in number and outrageously poor taste. Could it be that the agonies of a convoluted syntax promote a gallows-humor escapism in our C- programming community?<P>
The third CUJ Bad C Pun Contest was the worst, or in other words the best, so far. It would be nice to claim that we had a fair, scientific ajudgement algorithm (or some sort of groan-o-meter, perhaps), but in fact the selection process is quite subjective. Robert and Donna Ward make pass one to remove entries that duplicate previous winners. They also remove the strange submissions that seem entirely unrelated to C or puns or anything: one suspects that some contestants take <I>bad</I> to include <I>irrelevant</I>. Also expunged are those that already enjoy a wide circulation (we always receive at least twenty "O say can you C?"s and fifty "From C to shining C"s). The survivors are then cast into three heaps: bad, worse, and worser. I read all these, and after much puking and soul-searching, pick the ten winners (aka losers): Gold, Silver, Bronze, and seven consolation prizes.<P>
Push me the envelope, Donna. Fanfare. And the winners for 1992 are:<P>
