<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0109_007E">CMAKE v1.00<A name="0109_007E"></FONT></h4></P>
CMAKE, a make utility for Microsoft C and Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit programmers, automatically determines dependencies from command lines and source files. This includes dependencies upon header files and resources such as icons, bitmaps, fonts, and cursors.<P>
A make file for CMAKE usually consists of nothing more than the CL, RC, MASM, LIB, and INK commands that are required to build a a given application. Samples are provided to help users get started. A complete manual, in the form of a QuickHelp-compatible help file, is also included.<P>
CMAKE v1.00 is distributed as shareware. The program may be downloaded from CompuServe. To locate CMAKE on CompuServe, use the IBM File Finder (GO IBMFF) and search for the keyword, CMAKE. The program is also available on hundreds of BBSs in the US. The registration fee for CMAKE is $25.<P>
For more information, <I>contact John Greschak, 50 W. 34th St. Apt. 14B8, New York, NY 10001, (212) 947-1327, CompuServe: 70744, 1417.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0109_007F">Gimpel Software Releases Flexelint 5.0 For Mainframes, Minicomputers And Workstations<A name="0109_007F"></FONT></h4></P>
Gimpel Software has released FlexeLint v5.0. FlexeLint is a C source code analysis tool. FlexeLint will analyze C programs and report on bugs, glitches, inconsistencies and redundancies. FlexeLint looks across multiple modules and so provides a perspective that a compiler does not give. It aids in developing and maintaining programs, and in porting programs.<P>
Two features of FlexeLint 5.0 are a strong type-checking facility and a control-flow based analysis of variable initialization. The strong typing facility is based on <I>typedef</I> types. The user may control both the types checked and the kinds of operations that are monitored. In addition, Boolean operations can be restricted to a Boolean type, and subscript types can be validated. A natural type hierachy is supported and can be supplemented by the user.<P>
The control-flow based analysis will report on posibly uninitialized variables. The analysis takes into account all C control structures as well as the properties of system functions such as free and exit and user-specified equivalents.<P>
Other constructs that are scrutinized in v5.0 are constant expressions, initializers, and expressions involving overflow or lost information. FlexeLint can be used on mainframes, minicomputers and workstations, including, but not limited to, UNIX, VAX VMS, ULTRIX, SUN O.S. Apollo, OS-9, IBM VM-MVS, and QNX. FlexeLint is distributed in obfuscated source form - a form that is easy to compile but difficult for humans to comprehend. It requires only K&amp;R C to compile but will support ANSI C.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0109_0080">New MKS LEX &amp; YACC v3.1 Features YACC Tracker<A name="0109_0080"></FONT></h4></P>
MKS has released MKS LEX &amp; YACC v3.1. In this upgrade to its UNIX system compatible scanner and parser generators, MKS has added YACC Tracker, a diagnostic aid which allows users to see inside their parser. YACC Tracker is not a debugger. Instead, YACC Tracker maintains a fullscreen display of the internals of the MKS YACC-generated parser. YACC Tracker lets the user interactively trace what a grammar is doing for particular input, and simplifies the task of locating problems in a grammar.<P>
As an aid to understanding the concepts of writing compilers and interpreters, MKS LEX &amp; YACC v3.1 includes a code generator for an extended desk calculator, illustrating concepts such as language scoping rules and code generation. Two additional examples for a desk calculator are also included, plus a tutorial describing how to set up symbol tables using these examples.<P>
MKS LEX &amp; YACC brings two language development tools available under UNIX systems to software developers working on DOS and OS/2. The vendor claims that MKS LEX &amp; YACC are fully compatible with lex and yacc on UNIX Systems V and BSD UNIX systems, and track the x/Open and POSIX.2 draft standards. Grammars and generated code are portable between UNIX, and OS/2 systems.<P>
<I>lex </I>and <I>yacc</I> are used in the development of other programs to produce software that analyzes and interprets input, such as an embedded command language in a configurable text editor. MKS LEX builds a lexical analyzer, a function that takes a stream of input and breaks it up into tokens according to rules the user specifies. MKS YACC (Yet Another Compiler Compiler) builds a parser, a function that takes a stream of tokens (such as provided by MKS LEX) and matches them against a grammar the user provides. When a portion of the grammar is matched, source code embedded in the YACC grammar file is executed, thus giving action to the parsed commands.<P>
MKS LEX &amp; YACC v3.1 with YACC Tracker retails for $299 and includes both DOS and OS/2 versions. The upgrade cost is $89. MKS offers a 50 per cent discount to qualified educational buyers. GSA pricing, LANs and site licenses are available.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0109_0081">C++ Persistent Container/Data Classes<A name="0109_0081"></FONT></h4></P>
PSW/Power Software has released their generic data structures product Loose Data Binder v1.6. LDB is a C++ persistent container class library. Having a stack-queue-deque-list-array interface and built-in sort, search, and iterate functions gives it full container capabilities in one flat class. Being persistent, a LDB can be saved on a stream for later reloading while multiple references to its elements are automatically resolved thus allowing for a network of containers. A streamable class is provided for packaging your data in a persistent wrapping. Source code is included with all PSW software tools.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0109_0082">32-Bit NDP FORTRAN, C, C++, and Pascal Compiles for Windows<A name="0109_0082"></FONT></h4></P>
Microway is now shipping EXWIN32, their 32-bit Windows Extender. This product provides 32-bit, multilanguage support for the Windows platform. NDP Fortran, NDP C, NDP C++, and NDP Pascal, Microway's protected mode 386 compilers, have been extended to take advantage of the Windows environment. As a result, programmers can now recompile their 32-bit applications and run them using the Windows 386 enhanced mode.<P>
EZWIN32 implements character-based I/O, making it possible to create or run a 32-bit character-based application in a window.<P>
Microway has taken a two-pronged approach with EZWIN32. The character-based side of EZWIN32 supports features of DOS and UNIX not available in Windows. These features are necessary to develop code on Windows and include the C concept <I>STDIO</I>, batch files, and file redirection, all of which are built into EZWIN32's command interpreter and are part of the NDP Windows compilers. As a result, EZWIN32 runs both the Department of Commerce FORTRAN Test Suite and the Plum Hall C Suite, making it easy to port existing DOS and UNIX programs to Windows.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0109_0085">More Windows Utilities from Blue Sky<A name="0109_0085"></FONT></h4></P>
Blue Sky Software has released RoboHELP. RoboHELP is an authoring tool for creating Help Systems for Microsoft Windows 3.x. RoboHELP generates source code for indexes, topics, keywords (for search), categories, defined terms, pop-up definitions, bitmaps, bitmap hot links, cross references, and hypertext links.<P>
Blue Sky claims that a second new release, Magic Fields, takes Windows data validation development from a professional specialty to an activity accessible to even non-programmers. Instead of writing code to do the input checking, the developer points and clicks to add predefined or custom-defined data entry fields. In addition, the developer can visually specify fonts and colors and add a 3-D NeXT look (similar to Lotus 123 for Windows look) to the fields. The grayed 3-D effect can also be applied to dialog box itself and to any of the other elements inside it.<P>
