Contributed by Russ Cooper (AZ), RMAXTask (a shareware version) is a library of C functions that lets you run one or more C functions together in a priority-based, cooperative, multitasking environment in which a task continues running until it explicitly relinquishes control by making a call to the multitasking system. RMAXTask provides full support for intertask synchronization and communication, timed delays, and access to the PC's keyboard.<P>
RMAXTask provides a more capable scheduler and better intertask communication than do simple round-robin task switchers such as Wayne Conrad's MTASK or the system described in the October, 1988 issue of <I>Computer Language</I> magazine, while avoiding the complexity of a full-blown interrupt-driven, preemptive system like Thomas Wagner's CTask (CUG 330).<P>
The distribution disk includes a large model of the library, complete documentation, a demo program, and short test programs. To obtain the source code for the library, you may contact Russ Cooper at RMAX Development Group, 1033 East Coral Gables Drive, Phoenix, AZ 85022.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0105_007E">CUG363 68020 Cross Assembler (2 disks)<A name="0105_007E"></FONT></h4></P>
This 68020 Cross Assembler v1.0 is an upgrade of the 68000 assembler written by Paul McKee of North Carolina State University in 1986, and released to the public domain by Marwan Shaban. Andrew E. Romer (England) has added the 68020 specific mnemonics (excluding the math-coprocessor mnemonics), and also introduced minor modifications. The source code has been modified to conform to the ANSI C Standard and can be compiled under Microsoft C or Zortech C v3.0 compilers.<P>
The distribution disk includes the complete C source code, makefile, documentation, assembler executable, and assembly source files for testing.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0105_007F">CUG Directory Volume III Available<A name="0105_007F"></FONT></h4></P>
<I><B>YES!</I></B> The long-awaited CUG Directory Volume III is available now! This directory covers volumes 250 through 299 in The C Users' Group Library. You will get file-by-file capsule information for each volume and reviews of some volumes &#151; for example, "MS-DOS Execution Profiler" from CUG259, "<I>cpio</I> Installation Kit Supports System Independent File Transfer" from CUG265, "Plotting Language Makes Dot Matrix Graphics More Accessible" from CUG266, and "CROBOTS Players Write Their Own Strategy" from CUG279. Of course, you can look for what you want precisely and quickly by using the directory's index. The directory costs $10. The special introductory offer includes a complete set of directories (Volumes I, II, and III) and costs $18. If you are looking for a guide to public domain and shareware C source code, this truly is the best.<P>
