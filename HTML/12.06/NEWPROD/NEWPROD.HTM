<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="012D_009B">iXOS Releases iXBUILD 3 with C++ Support<A name="012D_009B"></FONT></h4></P>
iXOS Software GmbH has released iXBUILD 3 in the United States. iXBUILD 3 is an object-oriented design tool for building graphical user interfaces (GUI) following the OSF/Motif standard. iXBUILD 3 supports object-oriented programming in C++. Using iXBUILD 3, programmers can combine Motif widgets into GUI components, or classes, that are portable and reusable. GUI classes provide a higher level of building block approach than Motif widgets.<P>
Based on concepts from Douglas Young's <I>Object-Oriented Programming with C++ and OSF/Motif, </I>iXBUILD 3 lets resources defined in a GUI class become "member variables" during the generation of C++ code. The GUI classes have a widget-like programming interface and become reusable in the development of other GUIs.<P>
Programmers can dynamically test their iXBUILD interfaces through a link to CenterLine Software's ObjectCenter, an integrated C++ programming environment. In addition, iXBUILD 3 can generate code for the Rogue Wave class libraries.<P>
iXBUILD is $4,500 for the first user licenses. The license fee includes the software and the user's guide with tutorials. Interfaces generated by iXBUILD 3 are run-time independent, and run on major UNIX platforms. No additional run-time software libraries or license fees are required. iXBUILD 3 is available in the United States from <I>UniPress Software, 2025 Lincoln Highway, Edison, NJ 08817; (800) 222-0550; and QUALIX Group, 1900 South Norfolk St., Suite 224, San Mateo, CA 94403; (800) 245-8649</I>.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="012D_009C">ViewSoft Introduces Utah for Windows/Windows NT<A name="012D_009C"></FONT></h4></P>
ViewSoft, Inc. has introduced Utah for Windows/Windows NT, a software interface that lets C++programmers create GUI applications without writing GUI code. Utah uses the Editable Object System (EOS), a Semantic Interface Technology created by ViewSoft that delivers automatic binding of GUI components to the base application, eliminating GUI code.<P>
To use Utah, programmers define C++ classes in the usual way, then choose and graphically arrange components that represent the classes' member fields and functions. Utah lets a developer create many views of a class, while view embedding and view inheritance let complex class views be reused. Utah's User Interface Styles let embedded views make changes when "dropped in" to existing dialogs, similar to how a word processor style lets a document assume an entirely new look without retyping. These "views" of class members are automatically bound at run-time to the underlying code. Utah also lets programmers remove or replace interface operations without affecting their code.<P>
Utah for Windows/Windows NT is $1,495. There are no run-time royalties. For more information contact <I>ViewSoft, Inc., 60 North 300 West, Provo, UT 84601; (801) 377-0787; FAX: (801) 377-0788.</I><P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="012D_00A4">HSS Releases Footprints v2.0<A name="012D_00A4"></FONT></h4></P>
Hardy Software Systems, Inc. has released an OS/2 real-time trace facility, Footprints v2.0. Footprints lets a developer capture real-time data and monitor a live process. Footprints consists of a DLL and a Presentation Manager executable. Developers use Footprints by including a header and linking to a DLL. The Dynamic Link Library contains four API calls used to implement tracing: initialize, terminate, trace, and check-trace. Using these C function calls, developers trace by assigning various data to any of the 64 trace IDs. Developers can also use the Check Trace feature to implement their own run-time debugging code.<P>
Footprints also archives selected data. During production runs, all tracing is ignored, with the exception of developer-selected error messages. During the development cycle, or when the user reports a problem, tracing can be activated from an external Presentation Manager interface. The user can turn on any or all of 64 various trace IDs to monitor and archive data or effect the logic flow of the program being traced. The user can then duplicate a reported problem and send the archive file to the developer for analysis.<P>
