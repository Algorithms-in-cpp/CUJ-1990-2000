<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="020E_010E">EST Corp. Releases Debugging System<A name="020E_010E"></FONT></h4></P>
Embedded Support Tools Corp. of Canton, MA has released its EST Series 300, the first integrated debugging system to operate exclusively through Motorola's CPU32 Background Mode.<P>
Background Mode is a feature that Motorola designed into its 68331, 68332, 68340 and 68HC16 microcontrollers. When Background Mode is enabled, developers can access debugging services that reside in the chip's microcode. The new EST Series 300 offers a high-level, transparent interface to Background Mode and the on-chip debugger. Like an in-circuit emulator, it does not need any target resources. Through Background Mode, it uses the debugging services embedded in the CPU32 microcode. Developers can use the product before the memory and communication subsystems are stable.<P>
The EST Series 300 provides the hardware and logic to enable Background Mode for debugging, and disable it for real-time execution. Using the 5Mb per second communications link, the product combines low-level background mode commands to provide the following system-level debugging features: download, boot, and halt the application; single-step or multi-step instructions; set simple or conditional breakpoints on RAM or ROM code and data; trace the execution of the processor; fill and move blocks of memory; and ran hardware diagnostic tests.<P>
Embedded Support Tools Corp. has ported a version of XDB 5.0, a leading C source-level debugger from Intermetrics, Inc., to the EST seies 300. XDB gives the series 300 an intuitive, multi-windowed user interface with complete symbolic and C source-level information.<P>
For realtime simulation, EST has built a CPU32 and 128K of RAM into the series 300. Additionally, the product comes preconfigured to work with the Motorola 68331/332 and 68340 EVS evaluation boards.<P>
The EST Series 300 is priced at $2,450. For $5,950, the Company bundles the XDB C source level debugger and the Inter-Tools Optimizing ANSI C toolkit with the EST Series 300. This package is available immediately for the 68330, 68331, 68332, and 68340. A version supporting the 68HC16 will be released shortly.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="020E_0116">IDE's C Development Environment Synchronizes Design, Source Code, And Documentation<A name="020E_0116"></FONT></h4></P>
Interactive Development Environments, Inc. (IDE) of San Francisco, CA has released the C Development Environment. New features include reverse engineering and code generation modules, and facilities to synchronize code and designs, query the shared repository, and navigate among the components. The complete environment, including Software through Pictures, Saber-C, and FrameMaker or Interleaf TPS, along with the new modules and facilities, is available directly from IDE.<P>
The C Development Environment reverse engineers source code into designs and generates source code from designs, and it maintains consistency between them throughout the development process. Developers can modify either the design or the code, or both, and sychronize them easily. Mangagers can have design diagrams of existing code and work in progress. Everyone can have complete documentation.<P>
The C Development Environment integrates tools from leading vendors into an open solution for developing C software on UNIX workstations and servers.<P>
Design Generator for C reverse engineers existing C source code into complete design representations and specification documents, and stores the information in a shared repository. The result is a full system view that includes structure charts with parameters, and data structure diagrams. All code and design information is deposited in a shared repository. Code Generator for C produces ANSI or K&amp;R C source code frames for design information stored in the repository. Developers can start with designs and generate C source code. As the work proceeds, the C Development Environment synchronization facility maintains consistency between designs and code by incrementally updating one to reflect changes in the other.<P>
The C Development Environment provdes multiple views of the systems being developed. Its navigation facility enables users to move easily among code, design, and documentation. For example, simply by selecting a function in the source code view in Saber-C, a user can immediately see that function's design representation in Software through Pictures.<P>
The C Development Environment query facility derives valuable information stored in the repository to help users make good decisions throughout the development process. Users can use the query facility to understand how objects in the system affect each other and to locate unused or redundant code. The query facility also encourages reuse of existing software modules by allowing users to select and evaluate modules of trusted quality, and adapt and incorporate them into new applications with a minimum of effort.<P>
A typical small work group configuration of the C Development Environment costs about $10,000 for each user. Design Generator for C costs $6,000, and Code Generator for C costs $3,000 for a single license. The new C Development Environment is available August 1 on Sun SPARCstations and will be available on digital ULTRIX, HP 9000, and IBM RS/6000 workstations within three months. <I>Contact Interactive Development Environments, 595 Market St., 10th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="020E_0118">RTXC Realtime Kernel V3<A name="020E_0118"></FONT></h4></P>
A new version of the ROMable real-time kernel for embedded systems is now available from A.T. Barrett &amp; Associates. The new version of RTXC expands the library of services offered in RTXC v2.2 while also enhancing the kernel's use in complex embedded systems. Like its earlier version, RTXC v3 features multitasking, pre-emptive scheduling, intertask communication and synchronization, as well as resource, memory, and timer management. In the new verison, the library of executive services now numbers over 40 functions providing a rich, yet configurable, software development environment for the realtime embedded systems designer.<P>
The new version operates with fixed or variable task priorities using pre-emptive scheduling between task priorities and round-robin scheduling within a priority. New executive services permit access of a system object (queue, mailbox, memory partition, etc.) with optional blocking while others permit inquiries about the state of a system object. The timer manager has been completely revised in the new version to improve efficiency and timing accuracy and to permit those executive services which block the requesting task to limit duration of the blockage by a specified timeout period.<P>
Being written almost entirely in C makes RTXC highly portable to different processors. Current ports exist for the Intel iAPX 80x86 family as well as Motorola's MC680x0 family of processors including the MC68302 and the new high-performance M683xx microcontoller. Other microcontroller ports are available for the Intel 80x96 and Motorola's M68HC11 and the new M68HC16. A new port for protected mode operation in Intel's 80386 will soon be released as well as ports to the Intel 8051 microcontroller and Analog Devices AD2100 family of DSP processors.<P>
RTXC ports are available with bindings to C compilers from Microsoft (C v5.1 and v6.0), Borland International (C++), Intermetrics/Whitesmith's Microtec Research, Sierra Systems, Software Development Systems (Cross Code C), Introl Corporation, Intel, Archimedes, Metaware (High C), and Analog Devices.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="020E_011A">Saber-C++ Now Integrated With ObjectStore ODBMS<A name="020E_011A"></FONT></h4></P>
Saber Sotware, Inc. has announced the integration of the Saber-C++ programming environment with ObjectStore, an object-oriented database management system (ODBMS) from Object Design, Inc.<P>
The result of a strategic alliance announced in November 1990, the availabliilty of the integrated products is of particular importance to software developers creating large-scale, data-intensive applications out of pre-existing object libraries, including CAD, CASE, electronic publishing and financial applications. This integration will give users the tools they need to retrieve, debug, and graphically browse objects in a variety of ways and quickly create database applications. In addition, because both products support C and C++, companies that want to move to object-oriented programming now have a solution that lets them protect their investment in C as well as immediately benefit from reuse of existing code libraries, easier maintenance and greater extensibility of software.<P>
Developers now have interactive access to the ObjectStore database through Saber-C++. Object-oriented programs can be developed, debugged and tested in the Saber-C++ programming environment and the resulting object can be easily stored in the ObjectStore database. Likewise, objects stored in the database can be "transparently" retrieved and brought into Saber-C++. The developer can then use Saber-C++ to manipulate and browse objects stored in the ObjectStore database as naturally as any other C++ object. This flexibility facilitates modular development, rapid prototyping, and testing, resulting in significant productivity gains.<P>
Saber-C++ is a UNIX programming environment for writing, understanding and enhancing C++ programs. It integrates a C++ interpreter, a comprehensive source-level debugger, graphical browsers, an incremental linker and a runtime C++ error detection system: ObjectStore is an ODBMS for developers of highly interactive, design-oriented applications written in C and C++. Along with providing complete database capabilities, the ODBMS works with existing applications and fully supports object-oriented development using C and C++.<P>
