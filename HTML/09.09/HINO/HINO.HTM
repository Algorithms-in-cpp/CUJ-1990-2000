Jeffrey S. Dean has updated his shareware package, PC Curses. The current version is v0.8 and includes minor bug fixes and new functions. The disk includes small and large memory model libraries for Turbo C v1.5 and Microsoft C v5.1, demo programs, and well-written documentation.

David Blum has updated his public domain window routines for text and graphics, WTWG. The current version (v1.2) contains several bug fixes as well as new features such as an HP laserjet/deskjet graphics printer driver. The disk includes all the C source code that can be compiled under Turbo C v2.0/C++ or Microsoft v5.1.<P>

Contributed by Kevin Hack (MO), UltraWin, a shareware package, is a small and fast text windowing library that allows unlimited windows. It was written specifically for systems that use text displays with many windows that overlap and update real-time in the backgroud. An exhaustive array of output functions are available, with full color control, scrolling (both up and down), and masking capabilities. Also included are input functions for data entry such as strings, dates, prices, and even user-definable templates. The distribution disk includes documentation, demo programs, small model library for Turbo C v2.00 or Turbo C++ v1.0. To obtain the source code, contact the author at Rt 1 Box 116C, Pleasant Hill, MO 64080.<P>

David Blum (CA) has contributed a collection of routines written in C++. A class, <I>String</I> provides BASIC-like string processing such as <I>Substring, Replace, Find</I> (an enhanced version of <I>strstr(), strchr(), strcspan()</I><I>, and</I><I> strpbrk()</I><I>)</I>, and <I>Tokensize</I>, as well as providing the ability to write statements like<P>
<pre>String A, B, C;
if (A==B) ...// compares string
// contents, not pointer addresses
 A = B + C;  // concatenate strings</pre>
A class, <I>Vlist</I> provides a flexible array of pointers to data objects. This allows creation of dynamic lists of pointers, and designed to work with WTWG (CUG 328) as well as <I>String</I>. Supplementary routines include filename and directory handling, a simple ASCII file editor (using WTWG), and some pop-up menu routines. The distribution disk includes C++ source code and header files. The programs were developed under Turbo C++.<P>
