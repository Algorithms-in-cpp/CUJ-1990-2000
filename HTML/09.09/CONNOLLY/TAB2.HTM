1       <I>Connect Presentation Space</I>   Establishes a connection between your
                                     program and the host.
5       <I>Copy Presentation Space</I>      Copies the contents of the presentation
                                     space to an area of memory pointed to
                                     by the specified pointer.
6       <I>Search Presentation Space</I>    Searches the presentation space to
                                     determine whether it contains the
                                     specified string, and, if found,
                                     returns an offset of that string in the
                                     presentation space.
3        <I>Send Key</I>                    Sends a string of keystrokes to the
                                     host.
4        <I>Wait</I>                        Checks the status of the connection to
                                     the host and determines when
                                     the communication line is clear.
21       R<I>eset </I>                      Disconnects the presentation space and
                                     resets the HLLAPI interface to its
                                     defaults (if they had been altered by
                                     the program). This function is called
                                     prior to exiting any program.
7        <I>Query Cursor Location</I>       Determines where the cursor is located
                                     in the presentation space, expressed as
                                     an offset from the beginning the
                                     presentation space.
99       <I>Convert Position or RowCol  </I>Converts the offset returned by
                                     <I>Query Cursor Location</I> into a
                                     row/column expression, and vice versa.
13       <I>Copy OIA</I>                    Copies the contents of the <I>Operator</I>
<I>                                     Information Area</I> to a string.
