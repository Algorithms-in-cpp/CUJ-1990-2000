<H4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Northwoods Ships GO++ v3.0</FONT></H4>
<p>Northwoods Software Corporation has announced the GO++ v3.0 software class library with Automatic Layout Option.</p>
<p>GO++ enables developers to produce user interfaces that display interactive diagrams of pictures (or nodes) and lines (or edges). Examples include assembly line flows, telecommunications networks, chemical reactions, process control systems, and many others.</p>
<p>The GO++ library can also handle very large problems that call for thousands of nodes and edges. It is easy to use because it extends and is tightly integrated with MFC (the Microsoft Foundation Classes). This reduces the learning curve so programmers can deliver better applications faster.</p>
<p>Version 3.0 includes an Automatic Layout Option, which enables the programmer to automatically control the placement of the nodes and edges on the diagram in order to achieve a layout that is easy for the end user to view and understand.</p>
<p>Pricing for GO++ 3.0 starts at $895.00. Automatic Layout Option may be purchased separately for $895.00. An upgrade package from GO++ versions to version 3.0 costs $495.00.</p>
<p>For more information, contact Northwoods Software Company, +1.603.866.5780; fax +1.603.886.5913; info@nwoods.com; www.nwoods.com/go/.</p>

<H4><FONT COLOR="#000080">National Instruments Provides Measurement Studio</FONT></H4>

<H4><FONT COLOR="#000080">SkyLine Tools Releases ImageLib Corporate Suite 5.0 and Doc-to-Net 6.0</FONT></H4>
<p>SkyLine Tools Imaging has announced ImageLib Corporate Suite 5.0 for Delphi 4 and 5 and Borland C++ Builder 4.0. Version 5.0 has upgraded memory for the larger images produced by the newer digital cameras. It also includes upgraded TWAIN scanning, which meets the specifications for the newer scanners. ImageLib Corporate Suite 5.0 allows developers to customize annotations and offers a magnifying-glass feature that allows the user to zoom into a specific area of the image rather than zooming into the entire page.</p>
<p>In addition, SkyLine Tools Imaging has released Doc-to-Net 6.0. A CGI application, Doc-to-Net 6.0 transforms a scanned TIFF image to a PNG, GIF, or JPEG, then anti-aliases it on the fly and streams it through the browser. This allows the user to view the document without downloading any plug-ins, and the anti-aliasing makes the file more legible.</p>
<p>Doc-to-Net 6.0 costs $599. Registered users of version 5.0 can upgrade for $395. A free evaluation copy is available from the company's website. </p>

<H4><FONT COLOR="#000080">VideoSoft Announces VSFlexGrid Pro 7.0</FONT></H4>
<p>Videosoft has announced VSFlexGrid Pro 7.0, a grid control for building user-friendly interfaces for displaying, editing, organizing, and printing data.</p>
<p>VSFlexGrid Pro requires just a few lines of code to create dynamic multidimensional views to group, search, sort, filter, subtotal, and pivot data.</p>
<p>VSFlexGrid Pro enables developers to customize the display and presentation of dynamic data in Windows, Internet, or intranet projects with a wide variety of methods for displaying, editing, formatting, organizing, summarizing, and printing tabular data. An alternative to using a Tree control, VSFlexGrid Pro may be used as an outliner for displaying data hierarchically, displaying nodes that can be collapsed or expanded to show branches containing additional data.</p>
<p>VSFlexGrid Pro 7.0 provides a choice of three different types of data binding, ensuring the smallest software footprint for any application. Developers can choose from an ADO/OLEDB data-binding version for compatibility with the latest database standards, a DAO version for compatibility with legacy systems, and a new light version that reduces footprint size and eliminates the need to distribute ADO DLLs in applications that don't require database support. Unicode support is also included. Because it is 100% backward compatible with the version of MSFlexGrid included in Visual Basic, developers can easily upgrade and enhance legacy applications.</p>
<p>New with Version 7.0, FrozenRows and FrozenCols properties allow users to freeze rows and columns on the grid so that they remain visible as the end user scrolls the control. The appearance of the frozen cells is customizable. The new WallPaper property allows developers to use any picture, logo, or texture as a backdrop for their grids. The new PrintGrid method allows programmers to print the grid with a single state, with complete control over paper orientation, margins, and footer text, or display a dialog box to let the user select and set up the printer.</p>
<p>Other new features include: custom data sources, translated ImageLists, column reference by key, range aggregates, easy ComboLists, better user interface, new event for data conversions, as-you-type searching, and improved design-time interface for setting properties visually.</p>
<p>VideoSoft VSFlexGrid Pro 7 is compatible with Visual Basic 5 and 6 and is available today. Single-user licenses cost $299; current users of VSFlexGrid Pro 6 may upgrade for $159. Multi-seat site licenses are also available.</p>

<p>Blinkinc has released DeltaPatch 1.2, a multi-platform change distribution system.
