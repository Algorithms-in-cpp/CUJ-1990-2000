<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0100_0071">Dashboard Introduces TrackDeck Utility For Windows and OS/2<A name="0100_0071"></FONT></h4></P>
Dashboard Software has released TrackDeck, a programmer's utility for Windows and OS/2 developers. TrackDeck is a software dashboard that allows programmers to examine a variable from their code and track its value as the program executes at normal speed. TrackDeck works with any language that can access DLLs. Special interface components ave available for C/C++, Visual Basic, Turbo Pascal for Windows, and ObjectVision.<P>
Programmers must specify the addresses of variables for TrackDeck to watch in their code. Values can be displayed on a dashboard window beside the program window. Data can be displayed as text, a dial or a time graph, with full control over size, color, axis and time units. Variable changes can be examined or their average, maximum, or minimum values displayed. TrackDeck's control panels can set up permanent displays of parameters. Variables being watched by TrackDeck can be accessed by a DDE link from other Windows applications. Customized dashboards can be included in applications distributed to users.<P>
TrackDeck for Windows sells for $129. Contact Dashboard Software, 4 Louis Ave., Monsey, NY 10952, (914) 352-8071.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0100_0076">ConVal Releases ToolDriver Environment for MS-DOS<A name="0100_0076"></FONT></h4></P>
ConVal Software, Inc., has introduced ToolDriver, a software management environment for MS-DOS that supports cross referencing and renaming (to change naming conventions). ToolDriver supports software written with any combination of C, C++, Oracle, Pascal, COBOL, FORTRAN, batch files, and other languages. ToolDriver also works with text files containing project documentation.<P>
When using ToolDriver to cross reference, a programmer identifies the parent disk directory containing the various application files. Files in that directory are scanned for references to one another. The results may be viewed online, printed, or stored in an export file for later processing. Cross referencing can be based on filenames or words from the text of source files.<P>
When renaming, the user specifies old and new names, and a source directory. The files, with their names transformed, are written to a new directory, ready for recompilation. Renaming is useful when porting an application to a new platform, or in bringing old code in line with a project's current naming conventions.<P>
ToolDriver provides an interface with windows and menus, mouse support, and online help. A demo is available from CompuServe [72330,1621]. ToolDriver is priced at $60. <I>Contact ConVal Software, 11607 E. Butter Creek Road, Moorpark, CA 93021, (805) 529-6847</I>.<P>

NCR Corporation has released a Windows-based graphical user interface development tool, NICE. NICE (Natural Interface for Computing Environments) is a software development kit designed to work wtih Microsoft's C and Visual Basic, and runs under Windows 3.1. NICE consists of a set of software tools, objects, and human interface design principles that provide a framework for designing more intuitive interfaces.<P>
NICE includes a library of custom controls, such as an edit box, keypads, multifunction buttons, and graphic buttons. The product is packaged with the NICE Human Interface Design Guide, which was created by a team of NCR human factors engineers employing user-centered design priciples. Through a series of checklists, the guide directs developers toward (according to its rules) better interfaces for performance and ease of use.<P>
Applications created with NICE can be used with touchscreen, mouse and pen input. According to NCR, in one case study, using NICE reduced retail employee training on an application from two hours to twenty minutes and those employees required 69% less help after training. NICE is best suited for computing environments where tasks are structured and repetitive. There are no royalty or runtime fees. NICE is priced at $295. NICE comes with 60 days telephone support. Addtional technical support packages are available. <I>Contact NCR Corportation, 2651 Satellite Blvd., Duluth, GA 30136, (800) 243-6423; FAX: (404) 623-7136</I>.<P>
