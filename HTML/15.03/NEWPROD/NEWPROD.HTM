               <p>MicroEdge, Inc. has announced the
                    release of Visual SlickEdit v2.0 for X-Windows. New features
                    include API Apprentice, which reduces complicated API calls
                    to filling out a dialog box (supports Win32, NEC, OS/2,
                    C-runtimes, and Java), a C/C++/Java code beautifier,
                    difference editing, selective display (code folding),
                    code-block selections, and hex editing. For those
                    programming on the Internet, Visual SlickEdit v2.0 offers
                    support for viewing HTML files for Netscape and Mosaic. In
                    addition to a long list of features, Visual SlickEdit also
                    offers extensive vi, EMACS, CUA, and Brief emulations.
                    </p>
               
               <p> The price for version 2.0 is $395 for
                    X-Windows with the exception of Linux and FreeBSD, which are
                    $195 each. For Windows, Windows 95, and Windows NT the
                    editor sells for $295, and the price for OS/2 is $219.

               <p>Zinc Software has introduced Zinc
                    DataConnect (ZDC), a database product that provides C++
                    access to relational databases. ZDC provides database
                    independence by transparently supporting different database
                    back-ends with a single object-oriented C++ database API;
                    thus relieving developers of the need to be an expert with
                    each database-specific API. If future circumstances dictate
                    a change in database back-ends, just recompile the ZDC
                    application. </p>
               
               <p> ZDC's thin-layer implementation
                    results in improved performance. ZDC translates its own
                    database independent function calls to the fastest native
                    API calls for each individual database. This is in contrast
                    to ODBC or other generic interfaces that generally exhibit
                    poor performance. As an additional benefit, ZDC allows
                    developers the convenience of doing initial development on a
                    small database, and then scaling to any other needed
                    database platform. </p>
               
               <p> Prices vary depending on Database
                    Access Modules and platform. </p>

               <p>the doss boss has released InCOPYnito
                    v1.01, an application used to prepare reports for claiming
                    copyright. InCOPYnito can be used to mask lines of code for
                    the copyright application report. While the source code
                    listing prepared for the copyright authorities has portions
                    blacked out, the report for the user has the same portions
                    visible with a light gray background. Thus, the programmer
                    knows exactly what parts of the code have been released.
                    InCOPYnito also supports multiple work sessions so that
                    legal and managerial feedback can be easily incorporated.
                    </p>
               
               <p> Despite InCOPYnito being a Windows
                    3.1 program, it can read and print large files. The program
                    can output to any printer with bit-block transfer
                    capabilities, including most laser and dot-matrix printers.
                    </p>
               
               <p> InCOPYnito is priced at $71. Shipping

               <p> Using a feature called the Executable
                    Model, users draw diagrams of the system to be built based
                    on their requirements. VisualMagic employs three different
                    kinds of diagrams: object models (business structures),
                    state diagrams (business processes), and rule diagrams
                    (business rules). Using these diagrams, VisualMagic creates
                    a system model that can operate as a functional
                    implementation of the software (i.e., the diagrams actually

               <p>Intrinsa Corporation announced Prefix,
                    a development tool designed to find software defects during
                    development, not in later testing cycles. Built around a
                    machine- and language-independent simulation engine,
                    Intrinsa's Prefix provides automatic, compile-time detection
                    of programming errors. </p>
               
               <p> Prefix is designed around Intrinsa's
                    patent-pending Software Component Simulation (SCS)
                    technology. SCS enables Prefix to provide exhaustive
                    analysis, allowing it to identify and report defects and
                    problems that tend to involve either error conditions or
                    interactions between components. </p>
               
               <p> A key feature of Prefix is the
                    automatic generation of models for functions as they are
                    simulated. In addition, Intrinsa supplies models for
                    operating and windowing systems. Prefix also offers a
