               <P>In the preface to The UNIX Programming Environment (1984),
                    Kernighan and Pike provide a brief history of UNIX and C.
                    They recount that Ritchie and Thompson rewrote the existing
                    UNIX kernel with C in 1973, breaking the tradition that all
                    major OSs were written in assembly language. Kernighan and
                    Pike explain the success of UNIX at the time as follows:</P>
               <BLOCKQUOTE><CITE>"We can discern several reasons. First,
                    because it is written in C, it is portable UNIX systems run
                    on a range of computers from microprocessors to the largest
                    mainframes. Second, the source code is available and written
                    in a high-level language... Finally, and most important, it
                    is a good operating system, especially for programmers"</CITE></BLOCKQUOTE>
               
               <p>Now, more than twelve years since
                    their analysis, these reasons still hold true and perhaps
                    even more true today. Thanks to the efforts of the
                    developers of GNU, Linux, and FreeBSD, the source code for
                    UNIX-derived operating systems is in fact freely available
                    and not just limited to a mere handful of licensees.</p>

               <p>The GNU project has been the primary
                    project of the Free Software Foundation (FSF) since its
                    founding in 1984. GNU, a recursive acronymn which stands for
                    "GNUs Not UNIX," focuses primarily on providing
                    enhanced versions of UNIX-compatible programs and libraries.
                    All GNU programs include complete C/C++ source and a special
                    license for redistribution of it. The hallmark of GNU
                    software is its portability, with most packages supporting
                    ten or more different CPUs or OSs. The cornerstone of the
                    GNU project is the GNU C/C++ compiler and library (better
                    known as g++ and libg++). The entire list of GNU freeware
                    would fill several installments of this column. Ill simply
                    list ten of the most interesting (to me) packages and the
                    pointers to get you started:</p>

               <h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Linux</FONT></H4>
               
               <p>Linux is a freely-distributable
                    implementation of UNIX for Intel, Motorola 68K, DEC Alpha,
                    and Motorola PowerPC machines. It supports a wide range of
                    software, including X Windows, Emacs, TCP/IP networking
                    (including Ethernet and PPP), and much more. Linux was
                    originally written by Linus Torvalds (Helsinki, Finland). In
                    the three years since, Linux has become one of the most
                    popular free UNIX systems available, and is continually
                    being developed by Linus and teams of people all around the
                    world. Ports for many other CPUs are in progress, including
                    SUN Sparc and MIPS chips.</p>
               
               <p>The Linux kernel is covered by the GNU
                    Public License (GPL), and is usually bundled with various
                    binaries that comprise a working UNIX operating system. One
                    of the most confusing things about Linux for the novice is
                    choosing which among the various pre-bundled available "distributions"
                    to install. To make Linux practical to use, distributors
                    always bundle it with many GNU utilities (see previous
                    section). Heres the best place to start:</p>

               <p>FreeBSD is an advanced BSD UNIX
                    operating system for PCs with excellent support for TCP/IP
                    networking, advanced technical features, and the ability to
                    run a wide variety of applications. It also offers easy
                    installation, and of course, full source code availability.
                    FreeBSD can run on Intel compatible CPUs with just 4MB RAM
                    and 60MB disk space available. TCP/IP support includes
                    Network File Systems (NFS), Network Information Service
                    (NIS), DNS, BIND, remote login (rlogin), FTP server, packet
                    routing including PPP/SLIP, and IP Multicast. Some of the
                    heaviest trafficked sites on the Internet are built using
                    FreeBSD and the GNU Apache web server. FreeBSD compatibility
                    modules allow you to run programs designed for Linux, SCO
                    UNIX, NetBSD, and BSDI UNIX.</p>

               <p>We live in an era where the
                    organization and retrieval of information can be the most
                    critical part of doing business. Relational databases have
                    emerged in the 1990s as the best choice for nearly all
                    applications of information organization and retrieval. In
                    this focus segment, Ill highlight some of the freeware DBMSs
                    that feature C/C++ interfaces.</p>

                    organizes source code, documentation, and support for this
                    new relational DBMS. Beagles features are accessible
                    primarily through its C-callable API. Currently, Beagle
                    supports a wide variety of UNIX platforms including: Linux
                    1.2.13, SCO Openserver, FreeBSD 2.1R, SGI IRIX v5.3, Solaris
                    v2.x, and HP/UX. Porting projects are underway for Windows
                    95, NT, and other platforms. A support mailing list is
                    available too. For code and docs, see:</p>

               <p>MetalBase, by Richid Jernigan (Norris,
                    TN), is a small but complete relational database. It has all
                    the pieces a relational database should have: C interface,
                    Curses interface for forms, report writer, and more.
                    MetalBase uses AVL-trees for efficient data access. It has
                    been ported to a wide variety of platforms, including Linux,
                    MS-DOS, Amiga, NeXT, Coherent, Macintosh MPW, SGI, and
                    Xenix. MetalBase does not take advantage of shared memory.
                    None of the interfaces are standard, but all of them are
                    easy to use. Join the discussion mailing list at

               <p>The Lqtext text retrieval package, by
                    Liam R.E. Quinn &lt;lee@sq.com&gt;, can answer simple
                    queries about what files contain a particular word or phrase
                    of interest. Lqtext has been designed to be reasonably fast:
                    it uses an inverted index with hashing (a simple kind of
                    database). This type of index requires about 30 to 50% as
                    much space as the original data (which you still need to
                    keep). Lqtext requires dbm (Berkeley db or sdbm) to store
                    its indexes. A discussion list is available at
                    lq-text-beta-request@sq.com. Lqtext supports most versions
                    of UNIX (except SCO). Permission required for commercial
                    use.</p>

               <p>Im looking for libraries that can
                    facilitate the development of a piece of software that will
                    display data in a graphical representation. The functions

                    and hopefully generate a moveable cursor that displays data
                    values at each point as the cursor moves across the graph.
                    Are there functions on the CUG CD-ROM? If not where would
                    you suggest I look?</p>

                    several books which can give you a fair start:</FONT></I></P>
               
               <p>C for Fortran Programmers </FONT></I>by T.D.
                    Brown (1990); Paperback; $22.95, ISBN 0929306015</p>
               
               <p>C for Pascal and Fortran Programmers
                    </FONT></I>by Gerald J. Lemay (1993); Paperback; $15.00, ISBN
                    1883496004</p>
               
               <p>From Fortran to C </FONT></I>by James F. Kerrigan
                    (1991); Paperback; $24.95 ISBN 0830676619</p>
               
               <P><I>All of these are available at Amazon
                    Bookstore (http://www.amazon.com)</FONT></I></P>
               
               <P><I>I have not seen the sort of line-item
                    comparison youre hoping for. I suggest you take your
                    question first to the comp.lang.fortran newsgroup (where
                    youll probably find the most people who know both languages)
                    or to comp.lang.c++</FONT></I></P>

               <p>I tend to use the AltaVista "Advanced"
                    query page. If I were looking for "C++ library source
                    code" I would try a query like:</p>
               
<PRE>              
C near library near (sources or "source code")
</PRE>
               
               <p>The term "near" means "within
                    eight words of." The "or" is inclusive. With
                    that query I got about 2,000 hits rather than 14 or
                    1,000,000.</p>

               <P><I>As you point out, many search engines
                    can be improved through the use of advanced query options
                    such as the proximity ("near") search. I have
                    verified your results and found yet another set of
                    interesting links which youll hear about in an upcoming
                    issue. Meanwhile, other readers are invited to send their
                    favorite search engine tips and tweaks to me &lt;sysop@HAL9K.com&gt;.</FONT></I></P>

               <p>In your November 1996 CUJ column, you
                    mentioned that no SNOBOL compilers could be found. I believe
                    that Ralph Griswald (who I believe was one of the authors of
                    the green book on SNOBOL4) made the language ICON after
                    SNOBOL4. I believe he is at the University of Arizona and
                    that the ICON project is still alive. You might send e-mail
                    to icon-project@cs.arizona.edu and ask about SNOBOL4.</p>
               
               <p>For those who remember, care about, or
                    still use the SNOBOL4 programming language, a mail
                    listserver has been established. To join the list, send a
                    mail message to listserv@mercury.dsu.edu with the line "subscribe

                    should be your real name (your e-mail address will be used
                    automatically for the subscription).</p>
               
               <p>Submissions to the list may be sent to

               <P><I>Ill share your detailed information
                    with the other readers. In fact, I dimly recall ICON being
                    named as the successor to SNOBOL4. I encourage anyone with
                    an interest in pattern matching and string manipulation to
                    give it a look. o</FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
