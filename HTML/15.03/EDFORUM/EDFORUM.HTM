               <p>I write these words from a motel room
                    just outside the Toronto airport. One of the risks of winter
                    travel to Ontario is the sudden snowstorm that paralyzes
                    traffic and grounds all planes. At least I had enough
                    traveler's sense to secure a room near the airport during
                    that gray period when rooms are still available and the
                    airlines won't yet admit they're not going to fly. So I got 
                    to watch Mozart's Don Giovanni on the telly from a warm bed
                    last night instead of camping out in a departure gate.</p>
               
               <p> Another risk of winter travel is far
                    worse. The same airline that is hauling me about just lost
                    one of its planes outside Detroit during my brief trip.
                    Twenty-nine of my fellow souls went down with it, ending all
                    concerns about earthly comfort for them. Wing icing is the
                    current leading suspect. So you won't find me complaining
                    about flights canceled due to bad weather. I'll take safety
                    over reliable scheduling any day of the week.</p>
               
               <p> The same day that plane went down,
                    Skytel's paging network went berserk for half an hour,
                    sending bogus messages far and wide. The alleged cause: "a
                    new customer was given a wrong kind of identification
                    number." But we all know better. Only bad software could
                    let a common human error wreak such havoc. So far I've read
                    no reports of any lives lost as a result of that hiccup, or
                    even any  significant monetary loss. But I wouldn't want to
                    be in Skytel's shoes today.</p>
               
               <p> My light reading for this trip was
                    Edward Tenner's Why Things Bite Back: Technology and the
                    Revenge of Unintended Consequences (Alfred A. Knopf, 1996).
                    Tenner was a classmate of mine at Princeton and a superb
                    writer even then. He has only grown more thorough and
                    exacting in the intervening years. It's a good read. And
                    it's chock full of cautionary tales for those of us who
                    would make complex systems, be they airlines or computer
                    programs.</p>
               
               <p> Tenner is not anti technology. Far
                    from it. He is quick to point out the many ways that
                    improved technology &#151; airplanes, computers, or whatever &#151;
                    has improved our lot. We live longer than our forebears, and
                    often in greater comfort with fewer catastrophes. But the
                    second-order effects of our complex systems often pervert
                    those first-order benefits. We live with more chronic
                    illnesses,  and often in greater fear of those fewer but
                    more spectacular catastrophes.</p>
               
               <p> I made this trip to visit a major
                    customer and help get some of my software working better
                    with the customer's product. It was a productive visit, but
                    there are still a number of loose ends. When I get home, I
                    have several bugs to track down. I plan to be extra careful
                    about checking my work. Tenner's recurring theme is that
                    complex systems demand continuous vigilance, if we don't
                    want them to bite back. </p>
               
               <p> Who knows, someone will probably
                    someday use my software in a program that predicts when wing
                    icing occurs, or in a program that queues up messages for
                    pagers. Your software might suffer a similar success. Think
                    about it.</p>
