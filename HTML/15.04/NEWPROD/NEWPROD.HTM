               <p>MathTools Ltd. has announced MAT&lt;LIB&gt;,
                    a Matlab Compatible C++ Matrix Class Library, designed for
                    development of advanced, scientific, high-level C++ code.
                    The library includes complex math, binary and unary
                    operators, indexing capabilities, signal processing, file
                    I/O, linear algebra, string operations, graphics, and over
                    300 mathematical functions. </p>
               
               <p> MAT&lt;LIB&gt; supports matrices of
                    doubles, floats, ints, and chars mixed in the program.
                    Images can be stored in matrices of chars, using one-eighth
                    memory storage. On many applications, where eight digits of
                    precision are sufficient, float-precision matrices can save
                    half the memory usage. Memory allocation and deallocation is
                    managed automatically. Graphics, both 2-D and 3-D, are 
                    supported in stand-alone applications using the freely
                    available graphics package, Gnuplot. </p>
               
               <p> A 30-days evaluation version of MAT&lt;LIB&gt;
                    can be downloaded from the MathTools home page. </p>

               <p>Geodesic Systems, Inc. has announced
                    the release of Great Circle for HP/UX. Great Circle uses
                    garbage collection technology to automatically eliminate
                    memory bugs in C and C++ source code, third-party libraries,
                    and legacy code. With the addition of HP/UX versions, Great
                    Circle provides the UNIX development market with a
                    cross-platform, automatic memory-management solution to the 
                    problem of memory leaks and premature frees. </p>
               
               <p> Great Circle is a linked library that
                    uses garbage collection to analyze and manage an executable
                    program's memory during run time when all of the memory
                    allocation and usage facts are available. This can include a
                    developer's source code, as well as legacy code, and
                    third-party components such as third-party libraries,
                    X-Windows, shared libraries, DLLs, and windowing libraries. 
                    Great Circle is available in DLL form, and comes with both a
                    transparent and a pointers version. </p>
               
               <p> Geodesic's Great Circle 1.03 supports
                    Softbench, HP C and C++, and g++ on HP/UX v10.10 and v9.0x.
                    The new HP/UX ports complement Great Circle's other popular
                    UNIX versions supporting Sun Solaris and SunOS platforms.

               Inter.Net.h++</FONT></H4>
               
               <p>Rogue Wave Software, Inc. has
                    announced Inter.Net.h++ vl.0, a C++ class library that
                    provides C++ classes for many Internet communications
                    protocols, including FTP, HTTP, SMTP, and POP3. All classes
                    are portable between major Windows and UNIX platforms.
                    </p>
               
               <p> Inter.Net.h++ uses a two-layered
                    architecture. The Agent layer provides classes at a higher
                    level of abstraction that perform complete protocol
                    transactions. With the Agent classes, developers can add
                    complete protocol functionality with just a few lines of
                    code. The classes in the Client layer give developers
                    fine-grained control of details of the protocol, allowing
                    them to build custom, specific solutions. </p>
               
               <p> Inter.Net.h++ uses Rogue Wave's
                    Threads.h++ library in a way that is transparent to the
                    developer. This makes it possible for developers to add
                    multithread-hot capabilities to their C++ Internet
                    applications without mastering the intricacies of
                    multithreaded programming. </p>
               
               <p> Inter.Net.h++ costs $495 for a
                    single-user license; annual support contracts are $245. For
                    more information contact Rogue Wave Software, 260 S.W.

                    announced an upgrade to its advanced text-to-speech (TTS)
                    system, Eloquence. Eloquence is a flexible TTS system that
                    produces high-quality speech with natural sounding
                    intonation. Linguistic algorithms parse the input text,
                    expanding abbreviations, acronyms, and numbers;
                    disambiguating homographs; and generating accurate
                    pronunciations. The system provides nine built-in voices,
                    including those of adults and children, both male and
                    female. Developers and end-users can easily create
                    additional voices by controlling such parameters as gender,
                    breathiness, roughness, head size, pitch, baseline, pitch
                    fluctuation, and speaking rate. The linguistic models and
                    specialized development tools underlying Eloquence make the 
                    system extensible and customizable. </p>
               
               <p> Eloquence runs on PCs (486/50 and
                    faster) under Microsoft Windows (3.1, 95, NT) and on various
                    UNIX platforms. The price of the SDK for Windows is $995.
                    The SDK upgrade price from Version 1.x to Version 2.0 will
                    either be $250 or free depending upon the original date of
                    purchase. </p>

               <p>TechBridge Technology Corp. has
                    introduced RIO Developer for C++v 1.1, an application
                    generator for developing C++ applications, using the
                    Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC). RIO Developer for
                    C++ v1.1 is an add-on to Microsoft Visual C++. </p>
               
               <p> Using drag-and-drop and
                    point-and-click, a programmer can connect MFC GUI controls
                    to many databases through the industry standard Open
                    Database Connectivity (ODBC) or Microsoft's Data Access
                    Objects (DAO) protocol. Users of RIO Developer can also
                    generate applications with advanced GUIs, without first
                    mastering MFC and C++ programming. </p>
               
               <p> RIO Developer's object-oriented
                    development environment assists a programmer deveoping
                    applications using a component construction approach. A
                    programmer first creates application components and then
                    visually combines them into an application. With a single
                    mouse click, a programmer instructs RIO Developer to
                    generate all the C++ classes and the associated code for the
                     whole application. To maximize reuse, application
                    components are stored in built-in object repositories and
                    can be re-used in other applications through inheritance,
                    shadowing, or copying. </p>
               
               <p> RIO Developer is being sold at an
                    introductory price of $279 until June 30, 1997. For more
