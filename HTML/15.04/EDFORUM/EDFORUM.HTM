               <p>I wish this here Internet phenomenon
                    would hurry up and sort itself out. Any day now, prices are
                    supposed to plummet and available bandwidth is supposed to
                    approach infrared frequencies. Or so I'm told. Right now,
                    I'm mostly experiencing chaos. And from what I hear from
                    various friends and associates, I'm not alone. </p>
               
               <p> For example, I got one of those neat
                    ISDN router boxes to connect my LAN to the Internet. It can
                    dial on demand, making a phone call in a fraction of a
                    second. It adaptively turns on the second B channel so I
                    just pay for the bandwidth I need at the moment. It hangs up
                    the phone when the packets stop flowing for a long enough
                    time, again saving on connect time. Or so the theory goes. 
                    </p>
               
               <p> In practice, my Internet service
                    provider (ISP) takes anywhere between 30 and 90 seconds to
                    validate each call. So much for rapid ISDN dialing. I get
                    billed, by both the phone company and the ISP, for the
                    connect time while waiting for that go-ahead. Because of
                    those long delays, I've had to stretch out the idle timeout.
                    So each brief phone call costs three times what it should. 
                    The result so far has been staggering monthly bills for
                    Internet access not much better, on average, than I could
                    get with a V.34 analog modem at a tenth the price. </p>
               
               <p> It doesn't help that most network
                    software is apparently written by people with dedicated
                    Internet access. They certainly treat it as a free
                    commodity. The net effect is that the mail services I use,
                    and even the Windows95 network drivers, feel free to
                    generate all sorts of TCP/IP traffic on a whim. I have a
                    teenager in the house who costs less, at least for phone
                    services. </p>
               
               <p> Our first Web site was cheap, but it
                    turned out to be in a low-bandwidth ghetto seldom visited by
                    those Web crawlers who get you into the important indexes.
                    The only usage statistics we got were ones we gathered
                    ourselves. So we paid thrice as much per month to move
                    closer to the Information Interstate. That was fine, until
                    we asked for the power to make secure transactions. Whoever 
                    prices Internet services has sure guessed wrong about what
                    this particular traffic will bear. </p>
               
               <p> My neighbors in Chelmsford, Mass. can
                    now get 300 KB dedicated Internet access over cable for
                    about sixty bucks a month. I live within long cannon shot of
                    them but can't hope for similar service for about another
                    year. Different cable company. Grumpf. </p>
               
               <p> On the plus side, we make good use
                    out of the Internet every single day. We ship manuals and
                    software to customers via e-mail and FTP. We download
                    megabytes in minutes that used to ride a diskette overnight
                    on a FedEx airplane. We advertise to good effect and check
                    out the competition via the World Wide Web. The addiction is
                    firmly entrenched. Now all we need is a good connection.
