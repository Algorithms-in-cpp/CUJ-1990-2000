               <p>Most discussion of the Year 2000 (Y2K)
                    Problem up until now has focused on legacy (read mainframe)
                    systems. However, even if legacy systems can be repaired in
                    time, the systems with which they communicate or exchange
                    data must be compliant as well, or the problem may persist.
                    Corporate PCs and mobile laptops are examples of such
                    potentially troublesome systems. </p>
               
               <p> To illustrate how easily a PC can go
                    bad, my Acer Acros 75mHz Pentium tower, purchased 2/95
                    (oops, 2/1995), fails IBM's suggested tests for Y2K
                    compliance woefully. IBM has produced a hefty document (See
                    ftp://lscftp.pok.ibm.com/pub/year2000/y2kpaper.txt or
                    http://www.software.ibm.com/) that, among other things,
                    suggests simple tests you can run on the PC system clock.
                    The IBM document expresses these tests in terms of
                    step-by-step instructions; below I describe the tests in
                    terms of what they are actually testing for. At this point,
                    I must issue a strong </p>

               <p> These tests will change the date on
                    your PC far into the future and then return it to the
                    present. Disable any software on your PC that could affect
                    your data, such as TSRs, backup software, disk
                    garbage-file-collection utilities, network agents, etc.
                    Also, remove your PC from any networks it is on, so the
                    fictitious dates don't get out and corrupt someone else's
                    system. Better safe than sorry. </p>
               
               <p> All these tests are accomplished from
                    the DOS prompt, using the time and date commands. (I'm
                    running MS-DOS 6.22 and Windows 3.1.):</p>

               <UL><LI>Check for correct rollover from
                    12/31/1999 to 1/1/2000, both with power off and power on. To
                    do this, you set date/time to one minute before 1/1/2000 and
                    wait for a couple of minutes. My system failed to rollover
                    correctly with the power off. (How many users do you think
                    will take a sick day on Monday, January 3, 2000?)</FONT></UL>

               <UL><LI>Check whether the system clock will remember dates
                    after 12/31/1999 through a power-off/power-on cycle,
                    depending on whether the clock arrived at the date from a
                    rollover or from being explicitly set. (Yes, it can make a
                    difference. My system could remember dates after 12/31/1999
                    that I had explicitly set, but not those that were reached
                    via rollover.)</FONT></UL>
                    
               <UL><LI>Check the preceding tests with the new date
                    02-28-2000. Does your system properly roll over to
                    02-29-2000? The year 2000 is a leap year. (The year 2100 is
                    not.)</FONT></UL>

               <p> For an eye-opening description of
                    dates, calendars, and an interesting routine for
                    representing and calculating date ranges, see the OSE
                    library described in the April 1996 CUJ. After I downloaded
                    the library, the file was in
                    OSE-4.3\INCLUDE\OTC\TYPES\DATE.HH. As of January 1997, you
                    could obtain the OSE library from
                    ftp://ftp.th-darmstadt.de/pub/programming/languages/C++/class-libraries/OSE, or http://www.dscpl.com.au/download.html.</p>

               <p>These are only a few basic tests. Some
                    hot backup-site third-party providers offer test facilities
                    for Y2K. You can install a copy of your data center and set
                    the date ahead artificially to test the compliance of your
                    in-house developed software. You can test leased or
                    purchased software as well. </p>
               
               <p> If you are in a support position,
                    test a sampling of all the revisions of hardware and
                    software you can. Contact vendors immediately for
                    resolutions. They will appreciate all the lead time they can
                    get.</p> </FONT>
