<A name="00A4_0000"><A name="00A4_0000">I am in the midst of installing several new C and C++ compilers on my laptop. The process already has me talking to myself. The world has sure changed in the year I spent in Australia. (I bought little software then because it's a) scarce and b) expensive Down Under.) These new packages are <I>big</I>.<P>
I felt pretty smug a year ago buying a laptop with 6MB of RAM and 120MB of hard disk. I divvied up the former among RAM drive and various flavors of managed memory. I split the latter into six 20MB partitions, to provide a few fire walls. It was hard to imagine hitting limits with all that real estate.<P>
A large software package way back then ate up 3MB of disk. It might require over a megabyte of RAM to run well. Such parameters pale beside modern requirements, however.<P>
I'm not even talking about loading libraries for every possible memory model &#151; I usually stick with just small and large. No, it's all those Windows support libraries that eat disk space. And the gazillions of support tools we now take for granted. A 10MB package is typical these days. Some can be twice that size. If you're a child of the Nineties, let me give you some perspective. In early 1979, I was assured that few CP/M machines would ever have more than 32KB of RAM and 256KB of diskette storage. (You couldn't write enough assembly language to fill up the former. You couldn't afford <I>two</I> floppy drives to go beyond the latter.) Luckily, I ignored those projections and wrote C compilers for machines twice as large. The hardware was there when the software demanded it.<P>
My laptop now has 10MB of RAM. I use on-the-fly disk compression to double the effective hard disk size. I'm looking into networking my PCs so I can have faster file access to a <I>really</I> big disk.<P>
Now there's only one problem remaining. I'm not sure that I'm writing any more code with these wonderful new tools. Or any better code.<P>
