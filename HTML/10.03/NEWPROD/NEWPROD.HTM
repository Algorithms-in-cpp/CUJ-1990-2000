<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00A6_004A">Softaid Introduces 80186EB Emulator<A name="00A6_004A"></FONT></h4></P>
Softaid has released an In-Circuit Emulator for Intel's 80186EB macroprocessor. The UEM is composed of two tightly integrated parts: a full featured emulator, and Softaid's Source Level Debugger. The emulator hardware gives both EEs and firmware engineers the resources needed to debug an embedded system; the Source Level Debugger (SLD) wraps a shell around the emulator that gives the user full control over C and PL/M debugging. It includes 131,072 hardware breakpoints, each of which can be set on virtually any condition or machine cycle type. The user can nest breakpoint conditions up to five levels deep to find particularly devilish bugs.<P>
The UEM's real time trace collects machine cycles as the target program executes. The source level debugger shows trace data in the original source form, so the programmer can debug in the same context he wrote the code.<P>
The UEM does come with a real time performance analyzer. The SLD automatically couples this to the C code, assigning one function per performance bin (255 maximum). A few seconds of work identifies time-critical routines that must be optimized. All UEM-Series emulators come with a memory access monitor that non-intrusively monitors all memory references. The user can specify areas of memory as being write protected, read and write protected, fetch protected (i.e., no fetches allowed), or open for any access. A breakpoint will occur if the mode is violated, immediately identifying code or pointers that "wander off." The 80186EB UEM costs $7500 and is available from stock.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00A6_004D">Quality Assurance From Softran<A name="00A6_004D"></FONT></h4></P>
C-Verify is a quality assurance tool which proves that your test suite has taken every possible path through your C-language program.<P>
All source modules which are compiled into the executable program are passed through the C-Verify preprocessor. C-Verify analyzes the program's logic and generates an index file containing a unique label reference for each logic branch. C-Verify also outputs a new version of the source containing function calls which generate a file list of all the logic branches taken when the executable is run.<P>
The source output by C-Verify is compiled and run. As the program executes, the output file is built from the C-Verify label references for each logic branch taken during the run. Many different tests may be executed, passing the resulting logic probes into the output file for analysis.<P>
When the test suite is finished, C-Verify compares the file containing all possible logic branches with the file containing branches actually taken, identifying which logic has and has not been covered by the test suite. The programmer may then devise additional tests which pass through the neglected logic and run C-Verify again until 100% coverage has been attained.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00A6_0052">High-Performance 80486-Based Eisa Single Board Computer<A name="00A6_0052"></FONT></h4></P>
Diversified Technology has introduced the ESP2000, an 80486 based EISA system processor. This processor is based on a passive backplane architecture and incorporates Intel's latest 82350DT chip set. Operating at 33MHz, the ESP2000 utilizes a CPU-to-memory protocol which allows the memory subsection to operate independently of the CPU clock. This protocol also insures a smooth transition to 50MHz board options planned for future release.<P>
The ESP2000's high performance is due largely to the internal cache in the 80486. In addition to the internal cache, the ESP2000 provides a local memory architecture that consists of four-way interleaving and 128-bit "burst" accesses to provide near zero wait state performance. Up to 64MB of system memory is supported and this memory is field upgradable accepting 256KB, 512KB, 1MB and 2MB by 36 SIMM modules.<P>
The ESP2000 also provides support for an optional Intel Turbo cache module. Both 64KB and 128KB modules are supported. The architecture implemented is a "parallel" cache; thus, it resides in parallel with the CPU and local DRAM. As a result, local DRAM cycles can by initiated in parallel with cache TAGRAM lookup, precluding any penalty typically associated with a cache lookup.<P>
This single board computer's bus operates at the EISA standard and ISA backward compatible bus speed of 8.33MHZ. The EISA bus DMA channels can operate in both eight- and 16-bit modes with EISA/ISA bus slaves and masters, and 32 bit modes with EISA slaves and master. The interface of EISA masters to memory is optimized such that the memory is capable of sustaining the full 33 megabytes per second bandwidth as defined in the EISA specification.<P>
Combined with one of Diversified Technologies' EBP series of EISA backplanes, the ESP2000 provides the EISA designer with a system capable of supporting six intelligent EISA bus masters simultaneously for demanding applications. To ensure compliance with FCC and Underwriters Laboratory regulations, the ESP2000 incorporates extensive design measures for EMI/RFI emissions control and U.L. safety requirements.<P>
The 33MHz EISA "486" ESP2000 without RAM is priced at $2,595 in single piece quantities. Allow 1 to 4 weeks delivery ARO. For further information <I>contact Diversified Technology Inc., (800) 443-2667</I>.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00A6_0056">Database Application Generator<A name="00A6_0056"></FONT></h4></P>
Novato-based software developer Kedwell has just released a new version of its database application generator, DataBoss. Unlike database management systems such as dbase IV and Paradox, DataBoss doesn't have it's own language. To create applications you team it up with a Pascal, C, or C++ compiler. While this can make some things more complex, it also makes DataBoss very flexible. If DataBoss doesn't give you quite what you want you can add your own code or use library functions to add extra functionality. it also makes it very easty to port DataBoss applications to other platforms, and since you're delivering a compiled program you don't have to worry about run-time or licenses.<P>
DataBoss supports Borland's Turbo Pascal v5.0, v5.5, and v6.0; Borland C++; Turbo C v2.0, Turbo C++; and Microsoft's C compilers v5.1 and v6.0. It can also be used with Microsoft QuickC compilers but the integrations isn't as tight. DataBoss can be used to create mutliuser LAN-based applications as well as single-user applications. It supports Novell, 3Com, Tops, 10-Net and PC-MOS systems.<P>
DataBoss creates applications that use B-tree indexed files, which are reorganized whenever the database is updated so as to reduce data access times. Because it uses the B-tree indexes and because it is compiled, a DataBoss application is generally faster than a similar application developed using DBMS system.<P>
