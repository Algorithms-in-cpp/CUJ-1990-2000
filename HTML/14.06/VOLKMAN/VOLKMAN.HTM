                    comprehensive, longest established collections of source
                    code in the C/C++ universe. The latest CUG CD is now

               <h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"> Introduction</FONT></H4>
               
               <p>The C Users' Group remains as active
                    as ever, as this first semi-annual column attests. In fact,
                    the change from monthly to semi-annual updates has given me
                    more time to locate and catalog quality freeware and
                    shareware products in C and C++. The C Users' Group (CUG) is
                    releasing an updated version of the popular CD-ROM with
                    eight new volumes (described below) including all code 
                    through volume 445 as this column is going to press. </p>
               
               <p> Since 1981, the mission of the CUG
                    has been focused on low-cost distribution shareware and
                    freeware C/C++ source code. The CUG is an independent
                    organization sponsored by C/C++ Users Journal. CUG remains
                    impartial to compiler vendors or platforms. Although the
                    majority of recent volumes primarily support MS-DOS, CUG
                    focuses heavily on cross-platform compatability with UNIX, 
                    MS-Windows, and others.</p>

                New &#151; CUG #438: Serial Telnet for DOS</FONT></H4>
               
               <p>Riku Saikkonen (Finland) submits his
                    telnet client for MS-DOS (STELNET),which uses the serial
                    port as the I/O device. Although designed for Bulletin Board
                    System (BBS) applications, STELNET works equally well
                    without any BBS software. STELNET requires a FOSSIL driver
                    and the Waterloo TCP library. It supports binary mode telnet
                    (8-bit), and an "8-bit clean mode," in which all
                    256 characters are cleanly transferred in both directions.
                    STELNET does not do any terminal emulation of its own. It
                    will never change the data transferred (except where
                    protocol requirements designate). </p>
               
               <p> STELNET conforms to the "conditionally
                    compliant" definition of a telnet client as specified
                    in RFC 1123. The telnet code uses the Waterloo TCP library
                    (WATTCP), which uses a packet driver. WATTCP is not included
                    in this volume but is freely available at</p>
               
               <p>ftp://ftp.bhp.com.au/pc/selected/network/wattcp.zip</p>
               
               <p>Any network adapter with a packet
                    driver should work. SLIP should work, at least with the
                    EtherSLIP packet driver.</p>
               
               <p>STELNET is distributed under the GNU
                    General Public License, version 2, and thus includes source
                    code. Source code is all in C, which compiles under Borland
                    C in either small or large memory models. STELNET v1.00
                    (released on 12/20/94) is immediately available on CD-ROM as
                    CUG Volume 438.</p>
               
               <h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">New &#151; CUG #439: DOS
               Extender Library (XLIB)</FONT></H4>
               
               <p>David Pyles (Jackson, MS) offers his
                    DOS Extender Library for producing Protected Mode MS-DOS
                    applications. XLIB is an assembly language library which
                    greatly simplifies protected-mode programming under
                    Microsoft DOS. With only two calls to XLIB, assembly
                    language programs can utilize the simplicity and power of
                    32-bit processing. C and C++ programs can harness the powers
                     of 16-bit protected mode using inline assembly.
                    Additionally, the XLIB archive contains a second library
                    called EASYX, which allows all high-level languages to gain
                    access to extended memory. </p>
               
               <p> XLIB is designed for the Intel 386,
                    486, and Pentium processors. XLIB fully utilizes the 32-bit
                    processing powers of these chips and makes these powers
                    available to the user. The compactness of XLIB follows
                    largely from the fact that much of it is written in 32-bit
                    code. </p>
               
               <p> XLIB is marketed as shareware and you
                    may evaluate it for up to 30 days. If you want to distribute
                    applications that incorporate XLIB, then you must register
                    it. Registration is $40 for the basic license and an extra
                    $20 if technical support is desired. It includes an
                    extensive 60 page manual in plain ASCII format as well as
                    sample code. XLIB works with either Borland or Microsoft C 
                    environments. XLIB v5.1 (released on 08/25/95) is
                    immediately available on CD-ROM as CUG Volume 439.</p>

               <p>George Vanous (Delta, BC) submits his
                    library of essential and efficient C-callable functions.
                    Although oriented towards MS-DOS, many of the algorithms are
                    relevant on other platforms such as Windows and UNIX.
                    BESTLibrary consists of 282 functions coded in assembly
                    language and 68 functions written in C. All calls require
                    far pointers (e.g. large memory model). The library 
                    functions are roughly categorized as:</p>

               <p>Mendel Cooper (Grantsville, MD)
                    contributes a volume of MS-DOS games: Wordy, ChessClock, and
                    Chaos Game. Wordy is an educational word-game study system
                    that builds pattern and word recognition skills used in
                    Scrabble (tm) and Boggle (tm). The Wordy practice game
                    checks words you unscramble against a 100,000 word
                    dictionary. Wordy also includes stand-alone Search, Anagram,
                     UnScramble, and word-pattern find utilities. A BINGO
                    utility looks up all valid permutations of letters of a
                    word. The 1DIF utility finds all legal words constructed by
                    substituting a single letter. WORDY received a five-star
                    (highest possible) rating in PC Computing magazine (December
                    1995, p. 365). </p>
               
               <p> ChessClock includes a digital
                    display, move counter, pause function, and more. It requires
                    VGA and 386 or better to run. It is also useful for timing
                    Scrabble (tm) games because its clocks may be paused.
                    </p>
               
               <p> One of the discoveries coming from
                    the new science of Chaos is that there seems to be an
                    underlying order in randomness.<A href="volkf2.gif"><IMG src="volktf2.gif" ALT="{short description of image}" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="110" HEIGHT="82" HSPACE="5" VSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>
                    The Chaos Game uses the Sierpinsky Gasket, a figure with a
                    fractal dimension of less than two (see Figure 2). The Chaos
                    Game requires VGA and 386 or better to run. </p>
               
               <p> The CUG Library edition includes full
                    Borland C/C++ source code for each program. Each of Mendel's
                    programs is shareware, with an extremely low registration
                    fee (less than $5) for each program. Mendel's Games
