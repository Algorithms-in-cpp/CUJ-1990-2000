               <p>ParaSoft Corporation has announced
                    CodeWizard, a C++ code analysis tool. Based on Effective
                    C++, by Scott Meyers, CodeWizard reads the code and displays
                    informative error messages indicating which rule from
                    Effective C++ the code violated. In addition, CodeWizard
                    specifies the filename and the exact line number of the code
                    containing the violation. </p>
               
               <p>CodeWizard determines whether a
                    particular rule is valid for a developer's code. Also,
                    CodeWizard adapts by learning the developer's preferred
                    rules. </p>
               
               <p>The introductory price for CodeWizard
                    is $999. Current Insure++ customers will receive a special
                    discounted price. </p>

               <p>Geodesic Systems has released its
                    automatic memory management software, Great Circle, for
                    Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0. Great Circle automatically
                    eliminates memory bugs without compromising a program's high

                    developers to write new code without calling free or delete.
                    Benchmarks indicate that most programs run at the same speed
                     or faster using Great Circle's automatic memory management.
                    With Great Circle's advanced garbage collection technology,
                    programmers retain the ability to customize memory
                    management without sacrificing performance. </p>

                    parser also understands incomplete and uncompilable code
                    that allows seamless integration with CASE and testing 
                    tools. SNIFF+ incrementally parses source code as changes
                    are saved ensuring all views are always up to date. A symbol
                    table API is included for writing custom applications.

                    applications. With the DAZEL SDK, Windows and UNIX
                    application developers can integrate functionality to
                    manage, control, and access distributed output resources
                    from applications developed with C, C++, PowerBuilder, and
                    Dynasty, as well as SAP and Oracle client/server production
                    applications. </p>
               
               <p>By incorporating DAZEL output
                    management capabilities, client/server applications will be
                    able to deliver documents for viewing or final form output,
                    including print, fax, e-mail, pager, and file destinations,
                    across an organization's geographically dispersed network
                    infrastructure. Final form output can be customer
                    statements, inventory reports, bills of materials, invoices,
                     or checks. </p>
               
               <p>DAZEL SDK for Windows (including
                    Windows 3.1, Windows 95, and Windows NT) costs $200 per

                    Requiring no source code changes and no debugging
                    information, MemCheck detects memory overwrites, memory
                    leaks, heap corruption, stack overwrites, stack overflow,
                    out-of-memory conditions, invalid or unclosed file handles,

                    32-bit LAT implementation connects Windows 95 and DEC
                    systems by giving Windows 95 users access to DEC
                    applications and by allowing both Windows 95 and DEC users
                    to share printers and other peripheral devices. </p>
               
               <p>SuperLAT for Windows 95 complies with
                    Microsoft's standards for 32-bit software. This VxD
                    implementation is a true 32-bit solution that enables
                    efficient execution, frees up conventional memory, and
                    optimizes Windows 95 multitasking. SuperLAT for Windows 95
                    works with 16- or 32-bit Windows terminal emulators. A
                    COMport redirector connects users to any LAT service, so no 
                    special drivers are required. </p>
               
               <p>SuperLAT for Windows 95 is available

               <p>WinWedge is useful for real-time
                    analysis, charting, and graphing of serial data into Windows
                    software applications. It can run in the background,
                    inputting data into one or several applications while other
                    tasks are performed on the PC. Different instruments can
                    send data simultaneously to different applications or to
                    several fields within one application. </p>

               <h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Algorithms Corporation Releases Dynace Object-Oriented Extension
               to C </FONT></H4>
               
               <p>Algorithms Corporation announced the
                    full source code release of their Dynace Object Oriented
                    Extension to C and Dynace Windows Development System at no
                    charge for personal, educational, and evaluation purposes.
                    This release coincides with the new release version 4.0 of
                    the system. The entire system may be downloaded immediately
                    from the Internet site at http://www.edge.net/algorithms. 
                    </p>
               
               <p>There are two major components
                    associated with this system, the Dynace Object-Oriented
                    Extension to C (Dynace) and the Dynace Windows Development
                    System (WDS). Dynace contains a preprocessor, include files,
                    and a library that extends the C or C++ languages with
                    advanced object-oriented capabilities, automatic garbage
                    collection, and multiple threads. WDS is a Dynace class 
                    library that enables a C programmer with no knowledge of
                    C++, Dynace, the Windows API, or message-driven architecture
                    to write real Windows applications with a minimum learning
                    curve and number of lines of code. </p>
