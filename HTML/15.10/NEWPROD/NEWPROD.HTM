               <p>Gimpel Software has announced the
                    release of PC-lint for C/C++ v7.50. PC-lint will analyze a
                    mixed suite of C and C++ programs and report on bugs,
                    glitches, and inconsistencies. One new feature is
                    user-defined function semantics. With this feature, the user
                    may specify constraints on function arguments, as well as
                    properties of function return values.</p>
               
               <p> Pointer Tracking, another new
                    feature, tracks pointers throughout the life cycle. This
                    feature yields diagnostics when inappropriate pointer
                    deletes or frees are issued, when leaks occur from undeleted
                    pointers, when custodial pointers (pointers having custody
                    of an allocation) are modified, etc. In addition, many
                    messages have been added to reflect the guidelines of Scott 
                    Meyers' books Effective C++ and More Effective C++.</p>
               
               <p> PC-lint for C/C++ v7.50 costs $239.
                    Current users can receive updates at a discount.</p>

               <p>MarshallSoft Computing has released
                    Winsock Interface Library for C/C++ v1.0 for Internet
                    winsock programming. The Winsock Interface Library is
                    designed to simplify winsock programming by performing many
                    low-level details automatically, while adding several
                    high-level functions supporting the most common protocols.
                    Written in ANSI C, the DLL functions can be called from C, 
                    C++, Delphi, Visual Basic, or any language capable of
                    calling Windows API functions.</p>
               
               <p> The library includes 10 example
                    programs implementing client DNS, Finger, SMTP, POP3, NTTP,
                    FTP, and HTTP protocols, and a WHO_IS client and server
                    program.</p>
               
               <p> Registration for the Winsock
                    Interface Library for C/C++ v1.0 costs $95 and includes full

               <p>The MathWorks, Inc. has introduced
                    Simulink 2.1, Stateflow, and Real-Time Workshop 2.1,
                    products for modeling, simulating, and prototyping real-time
                    embedded systems applications.</p>
               
               <p> Simulink provides a graphical
                    environment where users can create block diagram models of
                    their systems and then simulate the system performance live.
                    Stateflow gives the user the ability to model and simulate
                    the behavior of complex, reactive, event-based systems based
                    on finite-state machine theory. Real-Time Workshop allows
                    real-time execution of models from Simulink. Real-Time 
                    Workshop automates all steps of code generation, including
                    compilation, building, and downloading code.</p>
               
               <p> Prices start at $1,995 for Simulink
                    2.1, and $9,995 for Real-Time Workshop. Contact The
                    MathWorks for Stateflow pricing. Educational discounts are

               <p>Uniscape has announced Global C v1.0,
                    a software internationalization API and runtime library.
                    Global C helps developers create single source-code
                    applications that support major platforms and spoken
                    languages. The runtime library helps independent software
                    vendors prepare their products for translation and operation
                    in Asian and European languages, and enables client/server 
                    applications to process data within multi-platform,
                    multilingual environments.</p>
               
               <p>Global C allows developers to write
                    one source code that reads from various language-dependent
                    resource files. In this development model, linguists
                    translate application text into the language of each target
                    market, while developers focus on creating or upgrading the
                    technical core of the product.</p>
               
               <p>Pricing for Global C v1.0 varies
                    depending on the number of platforms and applications

               <p> Unlike wizard and expert utilities
                    found in most compiler IDEs, Genitor's graphical editing
                    environment continues to work throughout the code
                    maintenance phase. Users can continue to modify, move, copy,
                    delete, and generally manipulate MFC-related items without
                    working with text at the source- and header-file level. In
                    addition, users can generate documentation for their 
                    applications that intermixes relevant MFC documentation with
                    documentation for classes developed in-house.</p>
               
               <p> The Genitor Skeleton Classes for MFC
                    can be downloaded free of charge from www.genitor.com, or

               <p>Embedded System Products (ESP) has
                    released RTXC 3.2, an optimized real-time kernel for
                    ColdFIRE-MCF520x embedded targets. RTXC 3.2 has been
                    modified specifically to take advantage of ColdFire's
                    memory-saving, variable-length RISC processor architecture.</p>
               
               <p> The optimized version of RTXC 3.2 is
                    a full-featured, multitasking, real-time executive that
                    offers designers a small, fast, ROMable, and configurable
                    operating system solution. The scalable kernel offers over
                    72 kernel services and requires less than 9.5K of memory.
                    RTXC also features a compiler binding for Diab Data's D-CC
                    and C++ compiler suite, including an assembler, linker, and 
                    archiver designed for the ColdFire architecture.</p>
               
               <p> RTXC is royalty free with source code
                    included. Version 3.2 for Windows 3.1/95/NT prices start at
                    $8,500. All ESP products come with an initial one-year
                    warranty and a full year of technical support.</p>

                    application-defined columns, linked containers, and
                    irregular shapes. Also PAIGE supports scaling and print view
                    modes from 25 to 1,000 percent.</p>

               Releases ActiveEnterprise </FONT></H4>
               
               <p>NCompass Labs has released
                    ActiveEnterprise, an intranet/extranet publishing and
                    content/application management system. The ActiveEnterprise
                    System manages the content creation process by separating
                    layout from content. Content is componentized and stored in
                    a the central relational database, and the layout for the
                    content is stored as HTML templates that can be filled in by
                     multiple authors distributed across an intranet or
                    extranet. Because content is decoupled from format, each can
                    be changed separately. Moreover, a change in any one of the
                    content or template components is automatically reflected
                    throughout the entire corporate Web site.</p>
               
               <p> NCompass Labs is currently offering a
                    distribution program through the Web site.</p>
