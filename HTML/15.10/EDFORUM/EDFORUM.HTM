               <p>London was the place to be this past
                    summer, at least if you're a fan of the programming language
                    standards developed by ISO committee JTC1/SC22. The British
                    Standards Institute (BSI) played host to WG14 and the
                    American C standards committee J11 in June. They followed
                    with a two-day meeting of the ad hoc Java Study Group at the
                    end of that month. Then in July they hosted WG21 and the 
                    American C++ standards committee J16.</p>
               
               <p> A handful of old warhorses actually
                    attended all three meetings. Lucky for me, I'm no longer
                    among that number. Tana and I went just to the C++ meeting,
                    then up to Oxford for the weekend following. The UK
                    Association of C and C++ Users cleverly scheduled a two-day
                    conference on the heels of the C++ meeting so they could nab
                    speakers who were already in country. Bjarne Stroustrup was,
                     of course, the star of the show, but Dan Saks and I also
                    got a respectful hearing from a very attentive audience.</p>
               
               <p> For many years, BSI hosted meetings
                    at their digs in Green Street, smack in the middle of
                    Mayfair and convenient to the West End theatres. Then they
                    went and bought a building out in Chiswick, sitting atop the
                    Gunnersbury tube station. I guess I can't blame them they
                    needed the space but I sure prefer a five-minute walk to
                    Green Street from my favorite hotel to a 40-minute train 
                    ride from the same venue.</p>
               
               <p> I know I'm supposed to be there for
                    the meetings, but you have to understand how I feel about
                    legitimate theatre. To me, the highpoint of the trip was
                    standing for three and a half hours as a groundling in the
                    newly recreated Globe Theatre watching an excellent
                    production of Henry V. It's still powerful and moving four
                    centuries after opening night. And that was just one of four
                     plays we saw. Good trip.</p>
               
               <p> Oh yes, about those standards
                    meetings.</p>
               
               <p> The C committees are as conservative
                    as ever. They seem to be well on track to having a revised C
                    Standard approved before the end of 1999, so the C9X
                    monicker is not yet a joke. They are adding features mostly
                    of interest to numerical programmers, and otherwise changing
                    very little. I expect they'll generate little opposition,
                    but little interest or excitement as well.</p>
               
               <p> Sun Microsystems essayed a procedure
                    that would have led fairly quickly to ISO endorsement of
                    their Java language specification, with little or no
                    opportunity for tweaking in committee. The national bodies
                    voting within SC22 have apparently registered considerable
                    opposition to this approach. The Java Study Group wants to
                    keep studying for another year. Meanwhile, the industry 
                    chugs on, unassisted (or unencumbered) by a Java SC22
                    working group.</p>
               
               <p> Finally, the C++ committees mostly
                    did what they promised. They devoted the week to processing
                    national body comments from the second Committee Draft
                    ballot. They made the usual passel of changes, but offered
                    some hope that they're mostly done fiddling with C++. The
                    plan is still to vote out the final Draft International
                    Standard at the November meeting in Morristown, New Jersey.</p>
               
               <p> Good trip.</p>
