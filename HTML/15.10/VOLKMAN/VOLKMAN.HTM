               <p>Helping people find the libraries and tools they need on the
                    Internet continues to turn up interesting resources. Yes,
                    its true that the enormous growth of the WWW has made
                    searching ever more difficult (mainly due to the increasing
                    number of "noise" hits). However, the increase in
                    quantity and quality of programming resources I've seen in
                    the last two years makes it even more worthwhile.
                    Increasingly, you'll find me recommending books where
                    subject matter dictates a more exhaustive approach than most
                    websites provide.</p>
               
               <p> Of course, I've replied to each
                    request by email prior to publication. But if you've got a
                    better link or tool to offer than what I've come up with,
                    then send on a brief email to those readers. At this point,
                    reader requests are coming in so fast that what you'll see
                    printed here represents one-third or less of the total
                    volume. Read on; odds are you'll find something you've been 
                    looking for or maybe gave up looking for. Send your reader
                    requests to sysop@HAL9K.com.</p>

               <p>In the September 1996 issue of CUJ, I
                    cited a source for the "Free C/C++ Sources for
                    Numerical Computation Page" by Ajay Shah. Since then, I
                    have had trouble using that link and have found a better
                    presentation of Shah's same list by J.E. Hetrick at
                    University of Arizona (Tucson)</p>

                    experienced FORTRAN programmer on how to learn C++. I've
                    since been corrected:</i></p>
               
               <p>Carsten Arnholm, &lt;CA@dnv.com&gt;

               <p>I saw your questions in CUJ about
                    converting yourself from FORTRAN to C++. I am a long-time
                    (10+ years) FORTRAN 77 programmer who has now converted
                    entirely to C++. Having such a background, I think I can say
                    that you got the wrong answers.</p>
               
               <p> Question 1: What would be the best
                    way for a FORTRAN programmer to learn C++?</p>
               
               <p> Answer: Do not attempt to learn C++
                    by learning C first. C++ and C should be considered separate
                    languages. You are likely to end up as a C programmer if you
                    attempt this approach. Instead, I would recommend you follow
                    Bjarne Stroustrup's advice:</p>
               
               <p> a. Initially, use C++ as a "better
                    C." C++ used that way is actually simpler than C! You
                    can take advantage of features like passing function
                    parameters by reference, much like you already do in
                    FORTRAN. There is a wealth of other things in C++ which will
                    relieve you from some of the syntactic difficulties in C,
                    that seem extremely odd for FORTRAN programmers.</p>
               
               <p> b. Read some books and attend a C++
                    course (not a C course!). I would recommend the following
                    literature:</p>

                    which is pedagogic and quite easy to follow.</LI>
                  <LI>Advanced C++ Programming Styles and
                    Idioms, by James Coplien, ISBN 0-201-54855-0. A really
                    interesting book when you master the basics.</LI>
                  <LI>The Design and Evolution of C++, by
                    Bjarne Stroustrup, ISBN 0-201-54330-3. If C++ really catches
                    your interest, you will gain invaluable insight from reading
                    this book.</LI></UL></p>
               
               <p> Question 2: Is there a side-by-side
                    comparison (maybe on the Internet somewhere?) between the
                    languages such as...</p>
               
               <p> Answer: It's not quite that simple. A
                    better idea is to learn the language as described above, and
                    then you will realize the differences and similiarities.
                    However, I have worked out a document which describes
                    C++/FORTRAN 77 cross-language programming. I am sure you
                    will find answers to some of your questions there. Good Luck
                    in becoming a C++ programmer!</p>

               <p>I am writing a thesis on Monte Carlo
                    simulations. It handles electron trajectory simulations in

               <p>ISVAS 3.1 (Interactive Software for
                    Visual data AnalysiS) is an end-user visualization system
                    for the analysis of 3-D finite element simulations and of
                    voxel data. It can be used for visualization of general
                    unstructured grids with scalar or vector values defined in
                    the grid nodes, or uniform grids with scalar values. ISVAS
                    is a research prototype developed by Fraunhofer Institute 
                    for Computer Graphics (Fraunhofer-IGD, Darmstadt, Germany)</p>

               <p>The Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM)
                    provides a file format for capturing and retrieving
                    two-dimensional pictures. A set of elements is used for
                    describing static pictures. This picture information can be
                    exchanged between between different graphical software
                    systems and between different graphical devices. CGM is both
                    an ANSI and ISO standard.</p>
               
               <p> Gplot is a CGM interpreter freely
                    distributed by the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. This
                    interpreter allows you to view images in CGM format. Gplot
                    is written in C++ and will compile with either an AT&amp;T
                    C++ or GCC/G++ compiler. On a generic UNIX/X11 platform
                    gplot will compile with either Motif or Xview.</p>

                    have a CGM application. Would you please tell me where to
                    get the specifications of CGM. Thank you again for your
                    help.</p>
