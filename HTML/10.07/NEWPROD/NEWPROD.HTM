<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0158_00B6">IPT's Toolset Provides C for 1750A Projects<A name="0158_00B6"></FONT></h4></P>
Information Processing Techniques (IPT) has introduced a set of CASE tools and utilities that provide C support for projects based on the MIL-STD-1750A architecture. The toolset was designed for a VAX/VMS host. The Cross Development Toolset consists of four components: C compiler, assembler, linker, and source debugger. These tools, combined with the utilities package (consisting of format conversion programs, PROMable code producers, retargetable kernel for custom designed hardware, and C to Assembly interface samples) support engineering in the development of embedded systems.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0158_00B7">Whitewater Introduces Object-Graphics for C++<A name="0158_00B7"></FONT></h4></P>
Whitewater introduced ObjectGraphics for C++, an object-oriented graphics library that extends the Object-Windows class library of Borland C++ with Application Frameworks and Turbo C++ for Windows. ObjectGraphics provides support for graphics, including diverse shapes, bitmaps, icons, multiple fonts and text styles, in Microsoft Windows applications. ObjectGraphics for C++ masks the graphics engine in Windows and provides a simple set of graphics objects rather than primitive function calls. Users can create rendering tool objects such as "Pens," "Brushes," and "Textpens" to control graphics images and can specify drawing attributes such as line styles, fill patterns, colors, fonts, and drawing combinations. C++ source for Object-Draw, a sample draw application, is included. ObjectGraphics is priced at $195, $390 with source, and requires a PC-compatible with Borland C++ with Application Frameworks or Turbo C++ for Windows. <I>Contact The Whitewater Group, 1800 Ridge Ave., Evanston, IL 60201, (708) 328-3800; FAX (708) 328-9386</I>.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0158_00BB">Intel Announces C860 Software Development Toolkit<A name="0158_00BB"></FONT></h4></P>
Intel Corporation announced the C860 software development toolkit, a DOS-based C cross-compiler kit that generates code for the 64-bit i860 microprocessor. The kit includes a C compiler, assembler, linker, utilities, and a source-level software debugger. The compiler performs software pipelining and instruction scheduling optimizations to use the i860's dual operation mode and dual instruction mode. A built-in vectorizer rearranges code and data dependencies to take advantage of on-chip pipelines and caches in matrix calculations. The C compiler conforms to the ANSI standard and generates code in the COFF format (Common Object File Format).<P>
The C860 toolkit's Software debugger provides a windowed interface that allows users to load, execute, and debug code on an i860 target system at the source code level, as well as view and modify memory and registers.<P>
The C860 software development toolkit is priced at $4,000. For additional information contact a local Intel sales office or distributor; or <I>contact Intel at (800) 874-6835; or write for Intel Literature Packet #BP45, Intel Corp., P.O. Box 7641, Mt. Prospect, IL 60056-7641</I>.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0158_00BE">Rogue Wave Releases New C++ Libraries<A name="0158_00BE"></FONT></h4></P>
Rogue Wave Software, Inc., announced two new C++ libraries: View.h++, which they bill as "the first commercial" library based on Motif, and MouseWrapper.h++, a system for simplifying interactive graphics. View.h++ offers two levels of functionality, a low level that encapsulates the functionality of OSF/Motif, and a higher level that offers a Model-View-Controller architecture. The Model-View-Controller architecture ensures that all views of a user's data are refreshed whenever the data changes. Complex objects can be created with single function call. "Precanned views" have been provided, and custom views can be created by inheriting properties from an existing view. MouseWrapper.h++ manages object picks, drags, rubber banding, and interactive graphics. View.h++ and MouseWrapper.h++ are built on Rogue Wave's Tools.h++, so objects are persistent. <I>Contact Rogue Wave Software Inc., P.O.
