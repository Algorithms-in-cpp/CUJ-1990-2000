<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01AE_00EB">ILOG Announces ILOG BROKER And ILOG SERVER<A name="01AE_00EB"></FONT></h4></P>
ILOG has announced ILOG BROKER and ILOG SERVER. ILOG BROKER is a tool that lets C++ transparently support Distributed Object Computing (DOC) environments by minimally changing the header files. ILOG BROKER supports a set of 15 keywords used in an application's header files that let ILOG BROKER's preprocessor generate standard C++ code. These keywords indicate whether a class is distributed, whether a function is called synchronously or asynchronously, and whether a specific class is passed as an argument to a function. Once the header files have been annotated, the preprocessor generates the source code.<P>
Other features of ILOG BROKER include the following: support for standard C++ semantics, syntax, and compilation models; network breakdown security; debugging capabilities; passing of complex arguments to functions; and transparent generation of the communication protocol between objects based on RPC.ILOG BROKER is portable, with a single API across heterogeneous platforms such as Sun/Sun OS, Sun/Solaris, HP, DEC Alpha, PC/Windows, and NT.<P>
ILOG also announced ILOG SERVER, a tool for building dynamic servers of C++ Objects. Based on the concept of view coherence, ILOG SERVER supports a C++ preprocessor and a set of libraries with two types of service &#151; Object Model classes and Object Server classes. Like ILOG BROKER, ILOG SERVER's C++ preprocessor automatically generates C++ once the header files have been annotated by a developer using the predefined keywords. Once an object model has been designed, ILOG SERVER provides a way to dynamically search the C++ object in the model to create an object server.<P>
Both ILOG BROKER and ILOG SERVER support UNIX based workstations. ILOG BROKER and ILOG SERVER are priced at $5,000. For more information contact <I>ILOG, Inc., 2105 Landings Dr., Mountain View, CA 94043; (415) 390-9000; FAX: (415) 390-0946.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01AE_00EC">Liant Upgrades C++/Views<A name="01AE_00EC"></FONT></h4></P>
Liant Software Corporation has upgraded C++/Views, its visual programming tool with features for OSF/Motif (AIX, HPUX, Solaris 2, and SUN OS operating systems), as well as for OS/2 and Windows. C++ Views is an object-oriented application framework for developing multiple-platform, native GUI applications using C++. The upgraded version of C++/Views includes a library of 100 C++ classes that support GUI software development requirements, including interface design, data management, and event processing. Also included are higher level interface classes such as table, toolbar, and multiple document interface classes.<P>
According to Liant, a developer using C++/Views needs to create only one resource file, regardless of the number of platforms targetted by their application. A C++/Views portable resource file can be called, without modification, from an applications running under Windows, Windows NT, DOS character mode, OSF/Motif, OS/2 Presentation Manager, or Macintosh. C++/Views also lets developers port bitmap images.<P>
C++/View also supports a geometry manager that automatically manages the size and position of interface components within dialogs, letting the developer design applications that look correct on all platforms. The MDI feature lets users open several files within an application, cutting and pasting portions of documents into other documents. Also C++/Views has an object-oriented C++ architecture, adhering to C++ standards.<P>
Prices for C++/Views start at $749, depending on platform. For more information contact <I>Liant Software Corporation, 959 Concord St., Framingham, MA 01701, (508) 872-8700; FAX: (508) 626-2221.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01AE_00ED">Microway Releases Pentium Compilers<A name="01AE_00ED"></FONT></h4></P>
Microway has released a family of Pentium Compilers including NDP C/C++, FORTRAN, and Pascal. These product integrate technology for driving RISC, CISC, and Vector devices. The result is numerics code that executes on the Pentium, without faulting. Unlike Pentium integer code, which benefits from superscalar scheduling, floating-point Pentium code requires compilers to implement scheduling correctly, and to include advanced numeric optimizations, such as loop unrolling, numeric register caching, and numeric register coloring. The NDP compilers add Pentium scheduling, the use of FXCH instructions to streamline x87 stack accesses, and a peepholer, which results in smaller code. Another feature of the NDP compilers is dynamic linking.<P>
Stephen Fried, President of Microway, stressed that the Pentium performance is extremely sensitive to the code used to drive it. According to Microway, the use of full NDP optimizations sped up a simple double-precision matrix multiply by a factor of 23 to 1, while another benchmark used to measure floating-point scalar speed only improved 30% using the same optimizations.<P>
The NDP compilers run under DOS and OS/2. The Pentium version of the NDP compilers is priced at $995 under DOS and at $795 under OS/2. The company plans for a UNIX version in the fourth quarter of 1994. For more information contact <I>Microway, P.O. Box 79, Kingston, MA 02364, (508) 746-7341; FAX: (508) 746-4678; e-mail: tech@microway.com.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01AE_00EE">Superbica Releases C++ Coder<A name="01AE_00EE"></FONT></h4></P>
Superbica has released C++ Coder, a Microsoft Windows program which automatically generates C++ applications to run under Windows or 0S/2. C++ Coder can generate database programs, calculator programs, or C++ class libraries for use with multiple programs. C++ Coder can generate the code needed for searching, sorting, and querying databases; the code for making customized reports; and user interface code, including dialog boxes. According to Superbica, C++ Coder can generate up to 50,000 lines of code at a time.<P>
The code generator in C++ Coder lets the user create applications with multiple linked lists and arbitrary-length memo files. C++ Coder produces commented C++ including the code needed for maintaining relations between objects and referential integrity. C++ Coder can also generate dual-purpose programs that serve as both database managers and calculators, and includes an automatic documentation system which creates user manuals. Also included in C++ Coder is an automatic screen designer and a test file generator. The programs produced by C++ Coder are customizable since the user gets the source code that makes up the application.<P>
C++ Coder is priced at $500. For more information contact <I>Superbica, 38-11 Ditmars Blvd., Suite 166, Astoria, NY 11105; (800) 328-5115 or (718) 728-5115; FAX: (718) 628-5148.</I><P>

Advance Research and Applications Corporation (ARACOR) has released two C++ libraries for developing X/Motif applications on UNIX workstations. The first product is the ARACOR Class Library, or ACL, which includes 140 C++ classes. ACL provides a high-level C++ interface to Motif widgets and can be used with interface builders which generate UIL code. ACL provides an application framework from which user interface objects may be extended and customized. Constructors are used to create the interface objects which get static information from the .<I>uid</I> resource file created by the UIL compiler. ACL also includes standard classes for command string and error functions, utilities, and cursor location. Additional features of ACL include support of event handlers for X extension events and bX palette definitions as well as classes for manipulating X-images, XmStrings, XmFontLists, Pixmaps, GC's, Colormaps, and Visuals.<P>
The second product is the ARACOR Drawing Class Library, or ADC. The ADC Package is a toolkit of C++ classes for creating MacDraw- and Canvas-like interactive drawings under X/Motif while maintaining access to the X-Intrinsics. The drawings may be selected, dragged, resized, or reshaped, and can be drawn in the same planes as other graphics or objects. Four standard drawing types are included as well as documentation for creating additional types for the base classes.<P>
Both ADC and ACL support SunSparc 4.1.x, SGI IRIX 4.0.5, HP 9000/700, and HP UX 8.07. Source code and documentation are available. For more information contact <I>Advanced Research and Applications Corporation, 425 Lakeside Dr., Sunnyvale, CA 94086, (408) 733-7780; FAX: (408) 732-1996.</I><P>
