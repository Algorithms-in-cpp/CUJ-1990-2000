<H4><FONT COLOR="#000080">BAPSoft Unveils DLLAide v3</FONT></H4>
<p>BAPSoft Ltd. has announced DLLAide v3, utility software for Windows 95/98 that manages, checks, and archives DLLs. Running DLLAide after each installation of software avoids newer DLLs being replaced by older DLLs and allows DLLs that have been inadvertently replaced to be reinstated. DLLAide also makes it possible to check version numbers of a DLL and the date modified. With DLLAide, one version of a DLL can be replaced with another version of the same DLL that was on the PC when DLLAide was first installed, or that has been installed subsequently. DLLAide provides this functionality by maintaining an archive of the DLLs.</p>
<p>DLLAide v3 may be purchased online at the company's website. For a limited time BAPSoft is offering a 50 percent discount on new orders, which makes the cost on a single user license $17. An evaluation copy is available on request.</p>
<p>For more information, contact BAPSoft Ltd., +64.21.895.840; fax +64.7.838.2331; info@BAPSoft.co.nz; www.dllaide.com.</p>
