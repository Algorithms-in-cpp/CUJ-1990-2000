<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="023D_012F">Cray Research Upgrades Compiling Systems<A name="023D_012F"></FONT></h4></P>
Cray Research, Inc. has released upgrades of its three main compiling systems: the CF77 5.0 FORTRAN Compiling System, the Cray Standard C Compiler 3.0, and Cray Ada 2.0.<P>
These Cray Research compilers offer a distinct advangtage to users because they automatically optimize programs. With their support tools for enhancing performance, these compilers provide supercomputer users high levels of performance and reliability. In fact, Cray Research's CF77 recently placed first in industry tests performed at the Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory. And on the Perfect Benchmarks suite (a group of real application codes collected and evaluated by the Center for Supercomputing Research and Development at the University of Illinois) optimization improvements to the CF77 FORTRAN computer yielded an average speedup of 13 times for all the codes in this test suite, with some codes achieving speedups of up to 130 times. And Cray Ada meets US Department of Defense standards for mission-critical software &#151; a stringent requirement for reliability.<P>
The Cray Standard C Compiler also outperforms all other commercially available vectorizing C compilers. In contrast to competing products, the new Cray Standard C Compiler performs optimization and vectorization by default, which results in significant speedup without user intervention. In fact, the compiler is so reliable that UNICOS 6.0, Cray Research's newest release of its UNIX-based operating system, is also compiled with full optimization.<P>
The Cray Standard C Compiler also performs automatic parallel processing, called Autotasking2. Autotasking2 allows applications to utilize multiple CPUs without programmer intervention.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="023D_0130">Convex Announces Debugger To Analyze Optimized Code<A name="023D_0130"></FONT></h4></P>
Convex Computer Corporation has released the first commercially available visual debugger capable of analyzing highly optimized code at the source level.<P>
Optimized code introduces an extra level of complexity in debugging. As a result, traditional debugging practices are not as effective or as efficient in locating complex code problems. To solve this, Convex invested more than 11 man-years in extensive research and development to create a debugger that can:<P>
<UL><li>Debug highly optimized code in both FORTRAN and C.</li>
<li>Debug using a window interface instead of a command-line only. This window is available on graphics terminals running CXwindows and ASCII terminals running Maryland Windows.</li>
<li>Debug at the system instruction level, with full access to the system state including scalar, vector, and the system's communications registers.</li></UL>
Panasonic Advanced TV-Video Laboratories Inc., Burlington, N.J., used CXdb to help locate a third-party software code problem that had puzzled researchers for weeks. "We fired up CXdb and within a half an hour we had the answer. It turned out to be quite a sophisticated, subtle problem, too," said Bob Peloso, technical staff member at Panasonic.<P>
The windowing diagnostics feature of CXdb allows users to look at the disassembly code, the source code, and the program output all at the same time. The product also includes a menu system for the CXwindows interface that allows CXdb commands to be issued using a mouse. To further increase debugging efficiency, command files can be created to automate frequently performed tasks and users can debug, edit, and recompile programs without leaving the CXdb environment.<P>
An on-line help facility allows users to obtain a separate page of information on CXdb commands, concepts, parameters, and error messages. A CXdb on-line tutorial teaches users the basics of using the product and includes a sample session on advanced debugging.<P>
CXdb prices start at $9,500. For more information <I>contact Convex Computer, 3000 Waterview Parkway, Richardson, TX 75080, (214) 497-4230</I>.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="023D_0132">New OOP Library For Asynchronous Communications<A name="023D_0132"></FONT></h4></P>
Greenleaf Software has released Greenleaf Comm++, a class library for asynchronous communications. As a C++ library, it provides a hierarchy of classes which give the programmer simple access and control of serial communications with or without terminal emulation.<P>
Greenleaf Comm++ was designed with the intention of making the use of serial asynchronous communications within a C program as natural to the user as possible. The communication-related classes included with the library were designed to overcome the limitations of addressing the serial RS-232 ports through the operating system or BIOS.<P>
Classes are provided for serial port controls, modem controls, file transfer protocols, and calculation of check values. There are also classes that support hardware-dependent features. Careful use of encapsulation means that all of the hardware dependent parts of Greenleaf Comm++ are restricted to these classes which are derived from an abstract base class.<P>
Greenleaf Comm++ will accommodate interrupt-driven circular buffered service for up to 32 ports at baud rates to 115,200. Features include support for the Hayes Smartmodems, XMODEM, KERMIT, XON/XOFF and terminal emulation for the VT52 and VT100 subset. The library services the IBM serial ports as well as non-intelligent multiport boards from DigiBoard, Inc. Greenleaf Comm++ will run under both the DOS and OS/2 operating systems.<P>
Greenleaf Comm++ supports IBM PC, XT, AT, PS/2 386, 486 and compatible machines and the instruction sets for the 8250 and 16450 UARTs. Comm++ currently supports Zortech C++ and Boland C++ compilers.<P>
The list price for Greenleaf Comm++ is $199. Full source code is included as well as a complete technical support package. For more information contact Greenleaf Software, 16479 Dallas Parkway, Suite 570, Dallas, TX 75248. (800) 523,9830; (214) 248-2561.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="023D_0137">Software Package For Embedded Systems Development<A name="023D_0137"></FONT></h4></P>
Systems and Software, Inc. has released 386 Development PerformancePak, the first software package to integrate all the development tools needed to build 386/486 embedded systems applications. 386 DPP allows embedded systems developers to build and prototype 32-bit protected-mode code under MS-DOS before committing to target. 386 DPP includes:<P>
<UL><li>MetaWare High C</li>
<li>Link&amp;Locate 386</li>
<li>SoftProbe 386X</li></UL>
High C is a compiler that generates optimized 32-bit 386/486 code. Users can tailor High C to their needs with several controls and pragmas. High C also provides users with source code for target-dependent routines to configure libraries for specific target environment.<P>
Link&amp;Locate 386 accepts object files in Microsoft 32-bit and 16-bit CodeView format and Easy OMF-386, and generates executable files in ROMable Intel OMF-386 bootable format. Link&amp;Locate 386 gives developers complete control to map segments and tables into RAM or ROM. Users can also define segment descriptors, descriptor tables, and task, interrupt, and can gates for single-task and multitasking systems. As such, Link&amp;Locate 386 is the only linker that fully supports the 386/486 architecture.<P>
With SoftProbe 386X users can debug their 386 or 486 protected-mode programs under MS-DOS. SoftProbe 386X is a source-level native debugger with a rich command and macro language. It has a multi-window interface that allows viewing changes in registers, memory, program variables, and many more. SoftProbe 386X uses 386 debug registers to break on variable access. A breakpoint can be conditional and invoke commands or command macros when it is hit. Another unique debugging feature of SoftProbe 386X is the capability to collect and record execution history. The execution history can later be played back in either assembly language or high-level language statements.<P>
The 386 Development Performance-Pak provides 32-bit computing for embedded systems development in an integrated package. 386 DPP runs on a 386 PC under DOS and has a list price of $1,695. System &amp; Software, Inc. also offers 386 DPP for Sun SPARCstation hosts.<P>
