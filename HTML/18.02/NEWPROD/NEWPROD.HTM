<H4><FONT COLOR="#000080">US Software Announces NetPeer, SuperPeg, and GOFAST</FONT></H4>
<p>US Software has released NetPeer, a distributed operating environment and embedded desktop interface. NetPeer provides an embedded target application with a client, a server, and a real-time interface to remote services over a network, with or without an RTOS. Additionally, NetPeer provides a multiuser GUI, so many users can simultaneously connect to the same target.</p>
<p>In addition to the release of NetPeer, US Software has added SuperPeg Portable Embedded GUI to their SuperTask! and TronTask! RTOS packages.</p>
<p>Finally, US Software has announced that GOFAST, an ANSI C compatible, floating-point library for embedded systems, now supports the Hitachi C compiler toolchain for the SuperH microprocessor. GOFAST replaces a C compiler's floating-point runtime package. It features "link and go" operation with real-time embedded applications and is ROMable and reentrant.</p>
<p>NetPeer pricing starts at $7,500. SuperPeg, sold as an add-on to SuperTask! and TronTask!, costs $6,000 for a royalty-free, single-application license.</p>
