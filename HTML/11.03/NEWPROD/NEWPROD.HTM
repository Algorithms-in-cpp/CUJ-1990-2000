<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00D9_0058">ParcPlace Introduces VisualWorks<A name="00D9_0058"></FONT></h4></P>
ParcPlace Systems, Inc., has introduced VisualWorks, an application development environment (ADE) for corporate developers creating graphical, client/server applications that are portable across PC, Macintosh, and UNIX platforms (Sun, IBM, HP, DEC, Sequent). VisualWorks includes a GUI builder, database access capabilities, and a reusable application framework.<P>
The GUI builder provides a point-and-click palette and canvas, with layout tools that include a menu builder, an icon painter, and a color tool. ChamelionView, a component of the GUI builder illustrates portability of a new GUI across various front-ends, including Windows, Motif, OS/2 Presentation Manager, Macintosh, and OPENLOOK. ChameleonView allows developers to preview the new interface in the native application look of these platforms. VisualWorks provides direct access to Oracle and Sybase databases. Through Information Builders, Inc.'s EDA/SQL gateway, more than 48 different databases can be accessed.<P>
VisualWorks is priced at $2,995 for Windows, OS/2, and Macintosh, and at $4,995 for UNIX. Database drivers cost $495 for Oracle or Sybase and $995 for EDA/SQL. Contact <I>ParcPlace Systems, 999 E. Arques Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94086, (408) 481-9090; FAX: (408) 481-9095.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00D9_0059">Xionics Announces PowerTools and ImageSoft 2.0 for Image Processing<A name="00D9_0059"></FONT></h4></P>
Xionics, a developer of image acceleration technology, has announced PowerTools application programming interface for MS-Windows image processing, and ImageSoft 2.0, an update of their C library for image applications software. PowerTools consists of a Windows Dynamic Link Library (DLL) with ten high-level commands to control the aspects of monochrome document image processing. The PowerTools commands each operate by issuing a string of calls to several of the underlying C routines in Xionics ImageSoft Libraries. PowerTools Release 1.0 is available as object code, and is compatible with standard C compilers, such as Microsoft C and Turbo C.<P>
ImageSoft 2.0 encompasses over 80 routines for image processing: scanning, printing, compression/decompression, display, and enhancement. Xionics maintains a policy of "assuring complete backward compatibility" in its API. PowerTools is priced at $895, royalty-free. The price includes one year of technical support and software updates.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00D9_005A">Micro Digital Introduces smx++<A name="00D9_005A"></FONT></h4></P>
Micro Digital has announced smx++, an Application Program Interface (API) which allows C++ programmers to access smx (simple multitasking executive) multi-tasking features in object form. smx++ supports Borland C++ v3.1 and Microsoft C++ v7.0.<P>
smx++ is a C++ class library consisting of nine base classes and seven derived classes. Redundant and seldom-used smx functionality has been omitted and orthogonality has been improved, in order to create a simpler API. A shallow class hierarchy was designed to preserve performance. smx++ runs on top of smx and direct smx C function calls can still be performed, and smxProbe still works the same. The new design made all smx objects (e.g., tasks, messages, semaphores, etc.) fully dynamic &#151; deletable as well as createable.<P>
C++ developers can derive classes from the smx++ classes. For example, device drivers can be derived from the Bucket and Pipe classes, (which have been derived from the Software I/O Bus (SIObus) class).<P>
smx++ is priced at $2995 (including a royalty-free license), with source available for $1000, and smxProbe for $500. Contact <I>Micro Digital, Inc., 6402 Tulagi Street, Cypress, CA 90630-5630, (800) 366-2491 or (714) 373-6862; FAX: (714) 891-2363.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00D9_005B">Integrated Development Announces LibTools<A name="00D9_005B"></FONT></h4></P>
Integrated Development Corp. has announced LibTools, a set of programmer's tools for creating, managing, and exploring libraries of C, C++, Assembly, Xbase, and other Intel-, Microsoft-, and Borland-compatible object modules. LibTools provides extensive reporting and cross-referencing capabilities. LibTools can resolve public symbol conflicts, forecast overly-large executables, and verify module integrity. LibTools can show a complete list of the public and external references in a module, showing what will be linked in when you call a particular function. LibTools' LibComp utility can compare two libraries and produce a list of duplicate symbols, and LibTools can rename external and public symbols to resolve conflicts. LibTools also includes a Library Dump utility, which provides a detailed listing of the complete contents of a library. LibTools documentation includes tutorials, an introduction to library management, and tips on designing more granular libaries.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00D9_005C">Archimedes Adds C Tools for Hitachi Microcontrollers<A name="00D9_005C"></FONT></h4></P>
Archimedes Software, Inc. has introduced C cross compilers and debuggers/simulators for the Hitachi H8/300 and H8/500 microcontroller families. The Archimedes C-Cross Compilers for the microcontrollers follow the ANSI C standard and support all the required libraries. The compilers provide several memory models (six of the H8/300 and 11 for the H8/500). Pre-defined in-line functions support interrupt handling. The compiler provides both single and double precision IEEE floating-point library functions. The compilers generate relocatable code and the Archimedes linker generates any of 32 different output formats for different emulators and PROM-programmers.<P>
The family of C-SPY High-Level Language Debuggers/Simulators for embedded applications support the Archimedes C-Cross compilers. C-SPY is avialble in simulator and emulator driver versions. The emulator versions support the MIME-700 in-circuit emulator from Pentica Systems, Inc. The H8/300 and H8/500 Cross Compilers are hosted on PCs, HP 9000, Sun SPARCs, and DEC MicroVax and Vax platforms. The compilers are priced starting at $1295 for H8/300 on a PC. C-SPY is supported on PC compatibles, and priced at $1195 for the H8/300 and $1995 for the H8/500.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00D9_005D">Nu-Mega Announces BOUNDS-CHECKER 2.0, for MS-DOS Memory Protection<A name="00D9_005D"></FONT></h4></P>
Nu-Mega Technologies, Inc., has announced BOUNDS-CHECKER 2.0, an MS-DOS memory protection tool that provides real-time memory and heap protection. BOUNDS-CHECKER 2.0 can detect problems in a program's heap, stack, or data segment; handles array over-run detection; finds illegal memory accesses outside a program; and finds code overwrites automatically. BOUNDS-CHECKER adds a Smart Mode feature, with built-in heuristics to determine the legitimacy of a memory access, and avoid unnecessarily flagging legitimate out-of-bounds accesses (e.g., video memory, BIOS variables, etc.). BOUNDS-CHECKER 2.0 doesn't require anything to be linked-in or compiled, but can work directly with both Microsoft C 7.0 and Borland 3.1 with the VROOM overlay, as well as support memory managers such as QEMM.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00D9_005E">StratosWare Releases MemCheck for the Macintosh<A name="00D9_005E"></FONT></h4></P>
StratosWare has introduced versions of its error detection and prevention product, MemCheck for the Macintosh, for the Think C and MPW C environments. MemCheck requires no source code changes. MemCheck detects memory overwrites and underwrites, memory leaks, heap corruption, and other memory errors. MemCheck operates transparently, appearing only to report errors with source file and line information. MemCheck for the Macintosh detects failure of memory allocation routines, failure of many resource operations, invalid operations on unlocked or purged handles, and inappropriate use of non-resource handles. One include file per source module is required to configure projects, and an automated configuration tool is included, MemCheck can be switched on or off at runtime, linked out via the production library, or compiled out with no source code changes.
