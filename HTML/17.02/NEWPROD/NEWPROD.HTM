<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Cygnus Solutions Unveils Introspect</FONT></H4>

<p>Cygnus Solutions has released Introspect, a software-based debugger for real-time embedded applications. Introspect records the state of program execution and events for analysis at a later time without hardware, such as logic analyzers or emulators. Introspect provides non-disruptive data collection for real-time applications.</p>
<p>Unlike trace data collected on a host computer, Introspect provides target-side data collection, gathered without slowing down the execution of the target program. In addition, Introspect provides the capability to arrange trace experiments and then review and analyze results later. It allows developers to step through an application and see what may have taken hours or weeks to occur.</p>
<p>For pricing and additional information, contact Cygnus Solutions, 800.294.6871 or +1.408.542.9600; fax +1.408.542.9699; info@cygnus.com; www.cygnus.com.</p>
