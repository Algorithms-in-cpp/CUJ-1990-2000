Michael P. Marking (AZ) has submitted a set of programs that manipulate facsimile or scanner graphics images. He has implemented techniques to encode and decode Group 3 (or 4) images and techniques to extract and insert TIFF (Tag Image File Format) image files in C. The C source code should be fairly portable, though it was developed with Microsoft C v5.1 under MS-DOS. The related story appeared in the June 1990, <I>C Users Journal.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01A5_00EB">CUG318 RED; CUG319 CPP<A name="01A5_00EB"></FONT></h4></P>
Edward K. Ream has placed his commercial software, the RED text editor and CPP (C PreProcessor) in the public domain.<P>
RED v7.0 is a full-screen text editor. Different from common text edtiors, RED provides three modes: an edit mode, an insert mode and an overtype mode which decreases the use of control keys, much like the <I>vi</I> editor. RED also provides not only basic cursor movement and editing features, but a search that allows wild cards, replacement, undo, and block operations. From a technical point of view, RED contains two chief accomplishments: the screen is updated quickly, and arbitrarily large files are handled quickly. These achievements do not sacrifice portablity. In addition, the size of the <I>.EXE </I>file is 35K, incredibly small.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><P>
CPP v5.3 is a modern C preprocessor. With one minor exception, where CPP will complain about duplicate macro definitions, CPP conforms to the ANSI C standard. CPP provides several command line options to include comments in the output file, define and identifier, allow nested comments, specify search paths for <I>include</I> files, and cancel the effect of the first definition of a macro.</FONT></FONT><P>
Both RED and CPP will compile with Microsoft C v5.0 or later and Turbo C v2.0 under MS-DOS. <I>Make </I>and link files have been included for both compilers. The source code has been revised to take advantage of the latest features of the draft ANSI standard of January, 1988. Function prototypes and other modern features are used throughout.</FONT></FONT><P>
The distribution disk for both RED and CPP includes complete C source code, excellent documentation, <I>make</I> files, and programs with a debugging session of Edward K. Ream's Sherlock debugging system.</FONT></FONT><P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01A5_00ED">CUG308 MSU, REMZ &amp; LIST<A name="01A5_00ED"></FONT></h4></P>
Michael Kelly (MA) has updated his generic, doubly linked list program, List. The new version (v2.01) includes features such as an unlimited number of active lists, more compact and faster code, better error checking, and improved documentation.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01A5_00EE">CUG297 Small Prolog<A name="01A5_00EE"></FONT></h4></P>
Henri de Feraudy (France) has updated his original Small Prolog. This update was submitted in response to Lindsey Spratt's article in the March 1990, <I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=2>C Users Journal.</I> The update provides more comments in the source code and an improved <I>makefile.</I></FONT></FONT></FONT><P>
