<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01A7_00EC">Spawn Package Will Swap Code<A name="01A7_00EC"></FONT></h4></P>
Whitney Software, Inc., has released XSPAWN, a library that replaces the standard C runtime library spawn functions with functions that can transparently swap most of the parent process to expanded memory or disk before executing the child process. The parent process is automatically restored upon completion of the child process.<P>
The XSPAWN functions expect the same arguments as their standard C counterparts. The swap operation can be controlled through global variables. For example, the use of expanded memory can be disabled.<P>
XSPAWN includes all source code and libraries for Microsoft C and Borland's Turbo C. All standard memory models are supported. Price is $79.95.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01A7_00F7">Zortech C++ V2.1 Adds Features To Support Large Scale Programs<A name="01A7_00F7"></FONT></h4></P>
Zortech has released C++ v2.1 for MS-DOS and OS/2. The major, new features of this version are designed to let C++ programmers write, compile and debug large scale projects under MS-DOS.<P>
This release addresses MS-DOS memory restrictions with a combination of existing MS-DOS extender technology and Zortech's new Virtual Code Management (VCM) technology and new versions of the C++ debugger which have minimal memory overhead. VCM allows MS-DOS applications to contain up to 4MB of program code and still run in real mode. The VCM system does not require any changes to application source code (except assembly language). See page 37 in this issue for a detailed technical description of VCM.<P>
This release includes a version of the compiler incorporating MS-DOS extender technology, allowing the compiler to use extended memory when compiling applications with large and complex class hierarchies. The compiler can also be used to develop applications using the Rational Systems MS-DOS extender, which may be purchased separately. Such applications can exceed the 640K limit on 80286/386/486 systems with extended memory.<P>
The use of the same technology in the debugger allows it to relocate itself into extended memory, allowing much larger programs to be debugged. A virtual 8086 mode debugger is provided (for 80386 systems) which requires almost no conventional memory. A facility for remote debugging via the serial port has been added.<P>
Version 2.1 also features a 20 percent improvement in compilation speed, a new program development environment with a source level browser, multi-file editing and integrated compilation, improved code generation, refined code optimization, and a completely revised and expanded C++ Tools.<P>
Pricing on v2.1 is unchanged. Special upgrade pricing is available. Contact Zortech Inc., 4-C Gill Street, Woburn, MA 01801. (800) 848-8408 or (617) 646-6703; FAX (617)643-7969.<P>
