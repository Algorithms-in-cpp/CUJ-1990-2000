<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0041_0018">StratosWare Releases MemCheck v3.0 Professional for DOS<A name="0041_0018"></FONT></h4></P>
Stratos Ware Corporation has released MemCheck v3.0 Professional for DOS, an error detection and prevention tool for C/C++ programmers. MemCheck v3.0 Professional detects memory overwrites, memory underwrites, memory leaks, heap corruption, stack overwrites, out-of-memory conditions, and other memory errors without requiring any source code changes.<P>
MemCheck v3.0 Professional for DOS checks for memory overwrites and memory leaks in all parts of the host application, including third-party vendor libraries, with or without source code. Other features include detection of stack and static variable ovewrites, and a mouse-driven MemCheck control panel. MemCheck v3.0 requires no debugging information and can be used in combination with debuggers such as CodeView, Turbo Debugger, and WVIDEO. MemCheck v3.0 uses proprietary storage technology which, according to the company, makes it run "five to fifty times faster than any other, similar-featured debugger."<P>
MemCheck v3.0 integrates with existing C/C++ code and pops up at run time to identify errors by exact file and line number in the source code, or by functions called back to <I>main</I> if the error is found in object code. MemCheck v3.0 can be linked in or compiled with no source code changes. MemCheck v3.0 can be switched on or off at run time, and linked out via a "Production" library. MemCheck v3.0 Professional for DOS is available for the Microsoft, Borland, Intel, Watcom, and MetaWare compilers for $139.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0041_001A">AIB Upgrades SENTINEL<A name="0041_001A"></FONT></h4></P>
AIB Software, Inc., formerly Virtual Technologies, has upgraded its SENTINEL debugging environment for C/C++ and X-Window developers. SENTINEL v2.0 has added a graphical user interface and will be integrated with Hewlett-Packard's Soft-Bench development environment. Softbench is a C/C++ programming environment built on the framework for open, integrated CASE. SENTINEL is a library of routines that can be linked into UNIX C/C++ programs to help programmers locate and resolve hidden bugs in the use of dynamic memory. Providing run-time verification of pointer usage and dynamic memory allocation, SENTINEL traps memory errors, traces stack, and reports the source file, function name, and line number of offending statements. SENTINEL also gives developers the same level of information concerning the allocation of memory and where the memory was freed or overwritten.<P>
SENTINEL v2.0 supports HP's Soft-Bench on HP and Sun platforms, and IBM's implementation of the system on the RS/6000. SENTINEL's GUI will be available on currently supported platforms.<P>
Users will have their choice of three licensing options for SENTINEL v2.0: host-based licensing, which will let any number of users on the host access SENTINEL; floating network licensing which will provide licensed access to any one user on a network at one time; and floating registered use licensing which will designate one person per site by name as the licensed user. SENTINEL v2.0 ranges from $595 to $1895, and pricing is platform specific.For more information contact <I>AIB</I> <I>Software, Inc., 46030 Manekin Plaza, Suite 160, Dulles, VA 20166, (800) 296-3000 or (703) 430-9247; FAX: (703) 450-4560; e-mail:</I> info@aib.com.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0041_001B">Liant Upgrades C++/Views<A name="0041_001B"></FONT></h4></P>
Liant Software has upgraded its object-oriented development tool C++/Views. C++/Views v3.0 is a third-generation, object-oriented development tool that combines 100 ready-to-use classes with programmer productivity tools. This library includes interface, data, event, printer, and extended GUI classes. C++/Views uses the local GUI's toolkit whenever possible, allowing programmers to create native GUI applications. Features on C++/Views v3.0 include C++/Views Constructor, C++/Views Browser, and geometry management.<P>
C++/Views Constructor lets developers work visually with the C++/Views class library. C++/Views combines a visual interface builder with a browser, allowing users to switch between drawing and archiving portable resources to edit code which call these resources. The C++/Views Interface Builder is a WYSIWYG editing tool for designing and testing the behavior of portable resources (binary files of GUI objects such as bitmaps, dialogs, and menus). Portable resources are called from an application at run time. The same resource file can be called from Windows, Motif, Presentation Manager, Macintosh, or DOS applications. The C++/Views Constructor also lets users view and edit C++ code as they work within Constructor's object-oriented environment.<P>
The C++/Views Browser is a multiple document interface (MDI) application, which allows users to open and cut-and-paste among multiple C++ applications; view the class hierarchy; edit, inherit, add, and delete classes; and create and update header files, make files, and linker response files.<P>
C++/Views v3.0 also automatically adjusts the geometry of GUI objects so that the objects stay in their correct proportion and location when an application is moved to other platforms, or when the windows are resized. The API of C++/Views v3.0 includes a set of standard interface classes for designing MDI application windows. C++/Views v3.0 ranges in price from $149 for an upgrade to $2,999 for multi-platform suites.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0041_0021">McCabe Announces McCabe Tool Set v4.0<A name="0041_0021"></FONT></h4></P>
McCabe &amp; Associates have announced McCabe Tool Set v4.0, a reverse engineering and testing software tool. McCabe Tool Set v4.0 includes a Data Tool, enhancements to CodeBreaker, and a link to desktop publishing packages.<P>
The Data Tool, which will be incorporated into the core Battlemap tool. supports two McCabe data metrics: Global and User-Specified Data Complexity. Global Data Complexity measures the Cyclomatic complexity of a module's structure as it relates to global/parameter data. The User-Specified Data Complexity provides the same measures for a portion of the data. Data Tool also supports C/C++; shows data slices; highlights modules and creates classes of modules containing specified data; displays declaration and references of data; allows editing of source code containing data elements; generates reports based on current use specification; and generates global and specified data complexity, flow graphs, test paths, and data slices for modules in the current search list.<P>
The CodeBreaker, a tool to find redundant and reusable code, has been paired with BattlePlan, McCabe's forward engineering tool. CodeBreaker compares module paths, as well as a number of metrics and properties such as names, interfaces, design boxes, SPEC notes, and code; generates source code templates to match design; identifies existing code that can be reused; searches for pre-existing implementation of a design; compares program implementation with design; identifies reusable code by comparing a design description of what a module should do against physical copies of source code; and finds likely candidates of pseudocode that match a set of implemented code to reestablish the traceability of the code with its design. CodeBreaker includes user-configurable properties, and builds pre-parsed "repositories" that can be configured and loaded into CodeBreaker.<P>
McCabe Tool Set v4.0 can convert tool output to a format that can be imported to desktop publishing packages such as Interleaf and FrameMaker. For more information contact <I>McCabe &amp; Associates, 5501 Twin Knolls Rd., Suite 111, Columbia, MD21045, (800)638-6316; FAX: (410)995-1528</I>.<P>
