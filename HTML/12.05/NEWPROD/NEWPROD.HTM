<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0108_0082">Correction<A name="0108_0082"></FONT></h4></P>
In the December 1993 issue of <I>CUJ</I>, Aggregate Computing's upgraded NetMake utility was incorrectly listed as NetMake vl.4. The correct version number was 1.3. Aggregate Computing has since released a newer version, NetMake v1.3.2, as announced below.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0108_0083">Aggregate Computing Releases NetMake v1.3.2<A name="0108_0083"></FONT></h4></P>
Aggregate Computing, Inc. has upgraded its intelligent compiling system, NetMake, a distributed, parallel version of the UNIX make utility. Netmake replaces the traditional UNIX make utility normally executed on a single machine and executes compilations on an entire network of machines in parallel. NetMake uses an intelligent distributed processing engine, called NetShare, designed to allow parallel and distributed processing across heterogeneous operating systems and hardware architectures. NetShare automatically and intelligently locates and utilizes the "best" resources on the network to perform tasks.<P>
NetMake both reduces compile time and increases network reliability in production environments. The usability enhancements in NetMake v1.3.2 add to the reliability by giving users more detailed output information in an easy-to-read format.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0108_0085">IDE Announces StP/OMT and Integrated CDE<A name="0108_0085"></FONT></h4></P>
Interactive Development Environment, Inc. and the Advanced Concepts Center of Martin Marietta have announced Software through Pictures/Object Modeling Technique (StP/OMT) tools and OMT Success Packages on IBM RS/6000 workstations, Sun SPARC workstations and servers, and the HP/9000. StP/OMT supports various aspects of the object-oriented development process: requirements analysis, design, implementation, documentation, deployment, maintenance, and continuous development. StP/OMT is based on IDE's vS.0 architecture and supports multiple users in an open environment with a shared repository, version control and locking, consistency checking, inter-model navigation, and code and document generation.<P>
StP/OMT lets users: understand and define problem domains through the use of object, dynamic, and functional models; navigate between all three modeling views of the same object; and access information via a table-oriented browser that facilitates reuse of classes and class structures. StP/OMT also lets users partition the analysis/design model into subsystems in order to see the relationships between modules and move between views of class definitions and their implementation via programming environment integration.<P>
IDE has also integrated its Software through Pictures C Development Environment (CDE) with SunPro's SPARCworks development toolset. IDE and SunPro use ToolTalk, the application integration facility from SunSoft, Inc. to integrate their products. ToolTalk automatically passes messages between CDE and SPARCworks. Through the integration, C code developed with SPARCworks can be reverse-engineered in CDE to automatically generate structure charts and data diagrams. Conversely, forward engineering of design diagrams will automatically create C code frames. Other features of the integration include: an incremental synchronization feature which lets users check for differences between code and design, and perform incremental updates to either on a per-item or global basis; query the Software through Pictures shared repository; browse in either direction between the Structure Chart Editor and Static Sourcebrowser, or their SPARCworks tools; and automatically generate documentation through usermodifiable code review or design review templates. The integrated C development software is available on Sun SPARC systems running either Solaris or SunOS.<P>
StP/OMT licenses are $12,000 per user. Success Packages are $100,000 for 5-10 users. A single license price for CDE with SPARCworks integration ranges from $5,000 to $15,000 depending on platform.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0108_0086">Perennial Releases ASV v3.0<A name="0108_0086"></FONT></h4></P>
Perennial, Inc. has released v3.0 of ASV, UNIX Application Source Verifier. ASV checks the source code of C applications for constructs that violate the specifications of a selected operating system's (OS) standards. Such constructs complicate porting applications to other operating systems. ASV focuses on problems that are not detected by a compiler or lint, for example: use of optional, level 2, or withdrawn OS interface; local redefinition of system interface; and use of literal where a symbolic constant is expected (as in assignments to errno). ASV also extends lint in the area of OS-interfaced type checking. AVS reports inconsistent types for function arguments, as well as for return values and structure members.<P>
AVS v3.0 also reports language problems, such as faulty and non-portable constructs, which are detected by its built-in ANSI C preprocessor, compiler front-end, and lint. These built-in language tools let ASV operate as a stand-alone product. ASV does not rely on a system's header files. So AVS v3.0 is immune to portability problems such as missing or non-conforming interface definitions. For each OS standard it supports, AVS has a database which defines the system interfaces of that standard. ASV supports POSIX.1 1998 and 1990, FIPS Publication 151-1 and 151-2, SVID Issues 2 and 3, XPG Issues 3 and 4, and OSF's AES Revision A.<P>
AVS v3.0 is available for SunOS v4.1.3 and v5.1 on SPARCstations, and for HP-UX v9.0 on HP 9000 machines of the 400 series. For more information contact <I>Perennial, Inc., 4699 Old Ironsides Dr., Suite 210, Santa Clara, CA 95054; (408) 748-2900; FAX: (408) 748-2909</I><P>
