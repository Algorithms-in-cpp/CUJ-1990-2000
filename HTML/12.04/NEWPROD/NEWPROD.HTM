<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00E1_006B">Tom Sawyer Introduces Two Graph Layout Toolkit Products<A name="00E1_006B"></FONT></h4></P>
Tom Sawyer Software has released two Graph Layout Toolkit products. The two products automate drawing of large graphs or networks, The Graph Layout Toolkit is designed to provide real-time, automated, graph layout service through a family of class libraries written in C++ that include ANSI C APIs. The Graph Layout Toolkit supports Hierarchical Layout, a hierarchical library for use with compiler and software development tools, and Circular and Symmetric Layout. These libraries are designed for network management, design, and simulation applications.<P>
According to Tom Sawyer's release, "Bundled directly into an application, the Graph Layout Toolkit delivers an immediate face-lift to graphics applications with its enhancement of graph readability. Software developers see marked improvement in their graph output without making extensive changes to their code, and they find their products become far simpler to use. End users find they can better visualize relationships within complicated data when information is transformed into easily-interpreted graphs with Graph Layout Toolkit processing."<P>
The Graph Layout Toolkit supports DOS, OS/2, Microsoft Windows, Windows NT, Macintosh, and most versions of UNIX supplied with the Sun SPARCstation, HP 9000, IBM RS/6000, SGI, and Next machines. The company is incorporating the Graph Layout Toolkit into SunNet Manager, HP OpenView, and IBM NetView/6000. Tom Sawyer's Network Layout Assistant includes the Graph Layout Toolkit as core technology.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00E1_006C">Siemens Nixdorf Announces Three Products<A name="00E1_006C"></FONT></h4></P>
Siemens Nixdorf has announced three products, DiaViews++ v1.0, Object Oriented SQL Interface for C++ v1.0 (OSQLIF), and Extended C++ Standard Components v2.0. DiaViews++ v1.0 is a C++ class library that provides an object-oriented interface to OSF/Motif. DiaViews++ combines OSF/Motif Toolkit with C++ by encapsulating the Motif objects (Widgets/Gadgets), so there is a C++ class for every Motif object. Features of DiaViews++ include: a framework for developing reusable UI-components, callback objects, interface to the SNI Dialog-Builder, meta protocol, automatic generation of makefiles, and member functions that set and read Motif resources. Other features include: use of the SNI Extended C++ Standard Components class library, automatic releasing of allocated resources, and run-time checks.<P>
OSQLIF is a class library for developing SQL database application in C++. OSQLIF contains three parts: The SQL Data Types, the Dynamic Interface, and the Static Interface. The SQL Data Types is a C++ class library which contains a C++ class for every SQL data type of the database. Each class contains the data and a null value indicator. The error handling can be defined by the user. The SQL Data Types will be used from the Static Interface and the Dynamic Interface. The Dynamic Interface is a C++ class library for manipulating an SQL database with dynamically-built SQL statements. Classes include SQL schema components, and classes for creating SQL statements and SQL cursors from C strings. The Static Interface is a generator which generates C++ interfaces from a description of the projections and SQL statements.<P>
The extended C++ Standard Components v2.0, is a class library of pre-tested and reusable software components for developing software. Version 2.0 contains the "Standards Components Release 3.0" of USL and other classes including: container classes, time classes, support classes, string and symbol classes, graph classes, and others.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00E1_006F">MainSoft Adds Support for Microsoft Foundation Class Library<A name="00E1_006F"></FONT></h4></P>
MainSoft Corporation has added support for the Microsoft Foundation Class Library and applications developed using Visual C++ to its MainWin Cross-Development Kit (CDK). The MainWin technology provides conversion of Windows applications to UNIX while maintaining the original application's look and feel, or at the end-user's option, using a Motif-style appearance.<P>
The MainWin CDK ports applications using Visual C++ and written with the MFC to UNIX. MFC was designed to provide a high-level library that simplifies the Windows API by providing an object interface, enables object-oriented C++ techniques, and provides a degree of portability from 16- to 32-bit versions of Windows. Using the MainWin Software Developers Kit, developers can create multiple versions of an application to reach SUN, HP, IBM, and SGI workstations from the same code base that supports Windows v3.1 and Windows NT.<P>
Software documentation and manuals do not have to be modified because MainWin technology lets developers maintain the look and feel of the original Windows application. Developers can upgrade all Windows and UNIX versions of the application simultaneously because MainWin does not alter the underlying code of the original application.<P>
For more information contact <I>MainSoft Corporation, 883 N. Shoreline Blvd., Suite C-100, Mountain View, CA 94043; (415) 966-0600; FAX:(415) 966-0613.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00E1_0070">ImageSoft Releases ClassWorks<A name="00E1_0070"></FONT></h4></P>
ImageSoft Incorporated has released ClassWorks by XNET Corporation. ClassWorks is a C++ class library that abstracts the complete operating system's functionality, not just the GUI component. Applications can be written entirely in ClassWorks with no knowledge of the underlying operating platform. A re-compile ports applications to different platforms.<P>
Features of ClassWorks include: multithreading, blocking on threads, suspending threads, entering and exiting critical sections, semaphores, and inerprocess communication (IPC). ClassWorks provides a data entry object that automates moving data to and from the user-specified I/O area. Data is automatically converted to string format on input and back to its original form on output. This object understands NULL indicators used in relational databases and also uses dialog templates created by resource programs, such as Borland's Resource Workshop or DLGEDIT, which come with the platform's SDK.<P>
ClassWorks contains nine main categories of classes: Windows, resources, graphics, containers, system services, IPC, file and directory services, strings, and miscellaneous.

Software Research Incorporated has announced enhancements to its CAPBAK/X, a new product bundle, STW/Advisor, and an X-Window Server offer. CAPBAK/X, an X-Window-based capture and playback test automation tool, has added character recognition and virtual display capabilities. SR licensed OCR technology from Xerox Imaging Systems. The character-recognition capability finds text that has moved to a different location from when the text was created and also lets pixel images be converted to ASCII characters. A virtual-display capability was also added. With virtual displays a tester can run window-based tests in the background. The virtual display can also be used for load testing.<P>
SR has also added a third product, STW/Advisor, to Software TestWorks. STW/Advisor is an X-Window-based metric analysis product, a C static analyzer for syntax and semantic analysis, and a test data generator. The metric product, METRIC, provides the commonly-accepted software metrics for C/C++, Ada, and FORTRAN programs. The static analysis product, STATIC, provides syntactic and semantic information for C programs. The test data generator, TDGEN, supports substituting new, random or sequential data values into existing test scripts to provide additional coverage.<P>
SR has also announced that its Virtual X-Window Server will be available free until the end of April, 1994, allowing users to experiment with its utility for load generation. The character-recognition capability is available either bundled on the STW/Regression floating licenses or with a $250 additional cost per user to the STW/Regression price for node-locked licenses. Prices for STW/Advisor start at $5,000. For more information contact <I>Software Research, Incorporated, 625 Third St., San Francisco, CA 94107; (415) 957-1441; FAX: (415) 957-0730</I>.<P>
