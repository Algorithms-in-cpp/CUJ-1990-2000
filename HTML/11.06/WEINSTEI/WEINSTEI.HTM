Well, last column's news is reversed this time. Once again, and with no explanation, <I>comp.sources.unix</I> seems to have gone quiet, and <I>comp. sources.x</I> picked up just as I started writing this column. Who knows why these things happen, but I vote for the moderators running out of spare time. I know I have lately. Before <I>comp.sources.unix</I> went quiet again, two postings were made in the final flurry that came after the previous column's deadline.<P>
First, <I>dup</I>, a utility for SCO Xenix, adds a special device driver to handle the <I>dup</I> system call from an open. Thus you can pass <I>/dev/fd/0</I> to pass in the current unit 0 to a process. David J. Fiander <I>&lt;xenitec!golem!davidf&gt;</I> contributed <I>dup</I> for Volume 26, Issue 87.<P>
Second, a set of two utilities, called<B> </B><I>faucet</I>, extends the pipe concept over a<B> </B>network. <I>faucet</I> provides a sink to catch<B> </B>its input and send it over the network to<B> </B>a source on the remote machine, which<B> </B>then continues the pipeline. Robert Forsman<B> </B><I>&lt;thoth@raybans.cis.ufl.edu</I><I>&gt;</I><B> </B>contributed <I>faucet</I> for Volume 26, Issue 86.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01A4_0097">Too Many Files<A name="01A4_0097"></FONT></h4></P>
Programmers create many more<B> </B>files than they can possibly remember.<B> </B>You can easily forget the location of a<B> </B>file in the numerous subdirectories of<B> </B>a modern system. And the file names,<B> </B>while once meaningful, can become<B> </B>more and more cryptic as memories<B> </B>fade. Well, you cannot do much about losing track of the file<B> </B>itself, but while searching the disk for the files, perhaps<B> </B><I>describe</I>, posted by Tim Cook <I>&lt;tim@deakin.edu.au&gt;</I> as<B> </B>Volume 35, Issues 12-14 of <I>comp.sources.misc</I>, can help.<P>
To each directory, <I>describe</I> adds a database of file<B> </B>descriptions, placing the database in the <I>dbm</I> indexed file .<I>desc</I><I>.</I> (With<B> </B><I>dbm</I> this means you have .<I>desc.pag</I> and .<I>desc.dir</I><I>.</I>) Each entry<B> </B>in the database is indexed by name and inode number (to<B> </B>allow for finding it after a file rename). Then the <I>describe</I><B> </B>package adds a few utilities: <I>dl</I> &#151; a replacement for the <I>ls</I><B> </B>command, <I>describe</I> &#151; to set or list the descriptive comment for a file,<B> </B>and <I>patches</I> &#151; to support the descriptions directly with the<B> </B>common commands <I>mv, compress</I>, and <I>ftpd.</I><P>
Highlights from the remaining<B> </B>postings in <I>comp.sources.misc</I> this<B> </B>time include:<P>
With the need to wrap text from within an editor, and the Berkeley tool <I>fmt</I> not always available, Chad R. Larson <I>&lt;chad@anasazi.com&gt;</I> contributed <I>fill</I> for Volume 35, Issue 3. <I>fill</I> provides optional left and right justification, centering, paragraph indention or hanging indention, and boxed paragraphs. To use it from within an editor, you must be able to pipe a text object.<P>
If you are not running in Suns and don't have access to the OpenLook Ftptool, consider <I>ncftp</I> from Mike Gleason <I>&lt;mgleason@cse.unl.edu&gt;</I>, posted as Volume 35, Issues 4-7. <I>ncftp</I>, a tool to automate ftp transfers and make them more convenient, handles automatic anonymous logins, use of your pager to view files and directory listings, wildcard support for <I>get</I> and <I>put</I><I>,</I> and multi-site access in the same session. It even has a command-line interface to allow for noninteractive use.<P>
Angus Duggan <I>&lt;ajcdC@dcs.ed.ac.uk&gt;</I> has updated his <I>psutils</I> package to version 1.7 for Volume 35, Issues 8-11. This set of programs rearranges the pages of a PostScript file for printing or display, makes signatures, extracts pages or ranges of pages, prints multiple pages on a single page, and fits an encapsulated file within a given bounding box. It also contains utilities to add the proper Adobe Postscript Convention headers to Frame, WordPerfect, Microsoft Word, and Macintosh documents so they can be manipulated with the utilities in this package. Patch 1 was posted as Volume 35, Issue 110, to fix some bugs and better handle scaling for American Letter paper size.<P>
Stephen R. van den Berg's <I>&lt;berg@pool.informatik.rwthaachen.de&gt;procmail</I> was re-released at version 2.80 in Volume 35, Issues 21-32. <I>procmail</I> is a mail agent that sorts and processes incoming mail automatically. The most visible changes include full biff/comsat support, mailboxes in the home directories, better mailing list support, and numerous other enhancements.<P>
A new BBS package for UNIX, ix/MBox, was contributed as <I>mbox</I> for Volume 35, Issues 36-50 by Volker Schuermann <I>&lt;Volker.Schuermann@unnet.w.open.de&gt;</I>. This BBS uses the underlying UUCP, MAIL, and NEWS transport software to move its files, but it provides: A News reader (or you can use your own UNIX newsreader), an internal mailer for intra-bbs mail, a hook to UNIX MTAs for intersystem mail, variable and configurable command set, user-defined commands, international support. The package uses SX/SZ/SB and RX/RZ/RB for upload/download protocols, supports its own line editor and can use full-screen editors, includes a full-screen MIME RTF editor, and much more.<P>
An updated release, and transfer of control, of the UNIX shell<B> </B>contains <I>zsh</I> was contributed for Volume 35, Issues 51-72 by The<B> </B>Zsh Mailing List <I>&lt;zsh-list@cs.uow.edu.au&gt;.zsh</I> is a shell designed<B> </B>for interactive use and based on <I>bash, ksh</I>, and <I>tcsh</I><I>.</I> It also has a<B> </B>strong scripting language. This release, version 2.3.1, includes<B> </B>bug fixes, improvements in the <I>vi</I> line-editing mode, improved<B> </B>portability, RFS support, <I>ksh</I> compatibility mode, nested variables,<B> </B>array slices, and much more (the list goes on for about 100 lines).<P>
S. Manoharan <I>&lt;sam@dcs.ed.ac.uk&gt;</I> contributed a C++<B> </B>class for parsing command-line options as <I>getlongopt</I> for<B> </B>Volume 35, Issue 75. It supports long names and environment<B> </B>variables, but does not currently support abbreviations.<P>
The speed of the decompress side of <I>freeze/melt</I> caused a<B> </B>reposting of a complete 2.5 release by Leonid A. Broukhis<B> </B><I>&lt;leo@ipmce.su&gt;</I> for Volume 35, Issues 77-79. This supersedes<B> </B>the patches against version 2.4 that also appeared recently.<B> </B><I>freeze/melt</I> is a file compression/decompression system.<P>
Hugh F. Mahon <I>&lt;hugh@nsmdserv.cnd.hp.com&gt;</I> contributed<B> </B><I>ee</I>, a simple to learn editor for e-mail and such. Easy Edit's goal<B> </B>was to provide an editor that needed no instruction to learn to<B> </B>use. Although based on System V, it should work on other<B> </B>platforms if they have the appropriate curses support. It also supports<B> </B>X/Open localization for international character sets (single octet<B> </B>only). It was posted in Volume 35, Issues 80-84.<P>
Philip D. Howard <I>&lt;pdh@netcom. com&gt;</I> contributed a function<B> </B>library, <I>bitio</I>, that implements a bit stream on top of a byte stream<B> </B>(eight bits per byte). This bit stream is designed to be exchangeable<B> </B>between different platforms and retain the same bit order regardless<B> </B>of the endianness of the platforms. It includes macros and functions<B> </B>for writing from 1 through 32 bits per call and a complete test suite.<B> </B>It was posted as Volume 35, Issues 105-107.<P>
Wietse Venema <I>&lt;wietse@wzv.win.tue.nl&gt;</I> updated the<B> </B><I>tcp</I> wrapper program <I>log_tcp</I>, adding access protections.<B> </B>Contributed for Volume 36, Issues 4-6, <I>tcp</I> allows sites directly<B> </B>on the Internet, such as <I>dsi.com</I>, to control who accesses<B> </B>which services on our systems. New since the prior version are<B> </B>better protection against spoofed network addresses,<B> </B>extensions to the access control language, and portability changes.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01A4_0098">Patches<A name="01A4_0098"></FONT></h4></P>
On the patch front, the calendar/reminder program <I>remind</I><B> </B>from David F. Skoll <I>&lt;dfs@doe.carleton.ca&gt;</I> had three<B> </B>patches posted. Patch 2 in Volume 35, Issues 18-20 added<B> </B>support for non-English languages and generally internationalized<B> </B>the code, added ISO encoding to the PostScript output, and<B> </B>allows for more flexible formatting of calendars. Patch 3 in<B> </B>Volume 35, Issue 73 fixes a bug in the <I>RUNOFF</I> command and<B> </B>some problems with the ISO PostScript output. Patch 4 in<B> </B>Volume 36, Issues 1-3 allows for reminders to be sorted in the<B> </B>normal mode of operation, additional languages, and a new<B> </B><I>SCANFROM</I> clause to make "safe movable <I>OMIT</I>s" possible.<P>
Raphael Manfredi <I>&lt;ram@eiffel.com&gt;</I> posted patches to<B> </B><I>mailagent</I>, a competitor of <I>procmail</I>. Patch set 17-19, posted as<B> </B>Volume 35, Issues 33-35, contains many bug fixes and enhancements,<B> </B>including better bogus address recognition, auto reply based on<B> </B>keyword rules, <I>NOTIFY</I> (a utility that accepts a list of addresses),<B> </B>security enhancements, and enhanced support for the <I>From:</I> line.<P>
A rather large patch to the <I>xvi</I> editor was posted by John<B> </B>Downey <I>&lt;jmd@cyclone.bt.co.uk&gt;</I> in Volume 35, Issues<B> </B>98-104. Patch 1 fixed <I>xterm/vt100</I> updating, XENIX and System<B> </B>V compile problems, and removed the fixed limit on line<B> </B>lengths in input files. In addition, several other bugs were<B> </B>fixed. The patch takes version 2.15 to version 2.19.<P>
Tony Field <I>&lt;tony@ajfcal.cuc.ab.ca&gt;</I> submitted patch 4 to<B> </B>his <I>psf3</I> package for Volume 35, Issue 109. This patch to his<B> </B>PostScript print filter system corrects problems with ctl-D<B> </B>processing and some of the usage of the ISO-LATIN encoding.<P>
A small patch was made to James Clark's <I>&lt;jjc@jclark.com&gt;lprps</I> PostScript print filter for the <I>lpr</I> print spooler. This change,<B> </B>patch 2, makes <I>lprps</I> ignore a leading ctl-D in the input stream<B> </B>such as that produced by the Microsoft Windows print driver.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01A4_0099">X Is Back<A name="01A4_0099"></FONT></h4></P>
As I said, all of a sudden, <I>comp</I><I>.</I><I>sources.x</I> has started flowing again, so here<B> </B>are some highlights, mostly of games.<P>
<I>xtmines</I>, another version of the minefield<B> </B>game, where adjacent squares tell you how<B> </B>many mines are touching your square, was<B> </B>contributed by Timothy Tsai<B> </B><I>&lt;ttsai@crhc.uiuc.edu&gt;</I> for Volume 19, Issues 4-5. His<B> </B>additions include providing you with three hand<B> </B>grenades that can be used to cause mines to<B> </B>explode (causing all adjacent mines to<B> </B>explode in a chain reaction).<P>
Jonny Goldman <I>&lt;jonathan@Think.COM&gt;</I><B> </B>contributed a space invaders game,<B> </B><I>xinvaders</I>, for Volume 19, Issues 6-8. It is<B> </B>based on Terry Weissman's <I>roids</I> program<B> </B>and requires at least X11R4 to run.<P>
Steven Grimm <I>&lt;koreth@hyperion.com&gt;</I><B> </B>posted his latest version of <I>workman</I>, a<B> </B>graphical tool for controlling audio CDs in<B> </B>the system's CD-ROM drive. It provides<B> </B>all the standard features of a<B> </B>programmable CD player, but also includes a<B> </B>database that can store the artist's name,<B> </B>disk title, and track titles, can remember<B> </B>which tracks you like and don't like, and<B> </B>will automatically recall this information<B> </B>when the appropriate CD is inserted in the<B> </B>drive. <I>workman</I> is Volume 19, Issues 9-17.<P>
A searchable <I>od</I> octal(hex/ascii, etc.) dump<B> </B>utility was contributed as <I>xod</I> by Robert Starr<B> </B><I>&lt;rfs@se28.wg2.waii.com&gt;</I> for Volume 19,<B> </B>Issues 18-21. It provides the ability to search<B> </B>based on bytes and strings, and the ability to<B> </B>change display formats on the fly.<P>
Like <I>ncftp</I> above in the<B> </B><I>comp.sources.misc</I> group and XView's ftptool,<B> </B>Salim Alam has written and contributed<B> </B>a Motif-based, screen-oriented FTP<B> </B>client called <I>xgetftp</I><I>.</I> It provides an<B> </B>X/Motif user interface, remote directory<B> </B>caching, remote file viewing, and simple<B> </B>multiple file and directory retrieval. It<B> </B>was posted as Volume 19, Issues 22-25.<P>
One of the more unusual programs for X<B> </B>I've seen is <I>xodometer</I> from Stephen O. Lidie<B> </B><I>&lt;lusol@Turkey.CC.Lehigh.EDU&gt;.</I> Posted in Volume 19, Issues 37-40,<B> </B><I>xodometer</I> is a tool that tracks the total distance your mouse cursor<B> </B>moves since startup, and since the <I>trip</I> <I>reset </I>button was pushed. A<B> </B>strange concept, but then, perhaps it fits in nicely with the next program.<P>
Mark Martin <I>&lt;mmm@cetia.fr&gt;</I> submitted <I>xruler</I> for<B> </B>Volume 19, Issue 42. It creates a shaped window in the form<B> </B>of a ruler, or as a transparent grid, which can be used to take<B> </B>measurements in other windows. Strangely, it uses <I>shape</I><I>,</I><I><B> </I></B><I>xbiff</I>, and <I>awk</I> instead of C to perform its work.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01A4_009A">NetHack Updated<A name="01A4_009A"></FONT></h4></P>
The big news in <I>comp.sources.games</I> is the update to<B> </B>NetHack, one of the largest projects in the games group, <I>nethack31</I>.<B> </B>The 3.1 update is the product of two years work by over 30 team<B> </B>members from different countries. Submitted by Izchak Miller<B> </B><I>&lt;izchak@linc.cis.upenn.edu&gt;</I>, it spans all of Volume 16, Issues<B> </B>1-108. Yes, that's about 6.5MB of source. NetHack 3.1 is a new<B> </B>generation of NetHack. Quoting the announcement posting, in<B> </B>Volume 15, Issue INFO11: "Unlike 3.0, NetHack 3.1 is a<B> </B>multi-dungeon game. New dungeons branch off the main dungeon at<B> </B>different locations. A unifying mythology was adopted for the<B> </B>game. There are tasks which must be completed in various<B> </B>dungeons before the main task of capturing the Amulet can be<B> </B>undertaken. There are different quests for the different character<B> </B>classes. There is a new multi-level endgame full of surprises.<B> </B>Many of the monsters in NetHack 3.1 now can wield weapons,<B> </B>zap wands, read scrolls, and cast spells. Fighting them must take<B> </B>these special abilities into consideration."<P>
The game's display was completely rewritten. Now based on<B> </B>a line-of-sight principle, it gives a new feel to the game. The<B> </B>new display uses a standardized window interface that allows<B> </B>easy substitution and addition of windowing systems<B> </B>independent of operating system. For example, the UNIX port<B> </B>now supports X11 as well as the traditional tty. Numerous<B> </B>local changes were made, and many new monsters, objects,<B> </B>and intelligent artifacts were added. And, as they say, you will<B> </B>discover the details and the rest of the changes for yourselves.<P>
Dave Cooper <I>&lt;dcooper@datap.ca&gt;</I> officially released the<B> </B><I>xjewel</I> game previewed in <I>alt.sources</I> a while back for<B> </B>Volume 17, Issues 1-5. <I>xjewel</I> is an X port of the jewel<B> </B>dropping game from Yoshihiro Satoh of HP. This revision fixes<B> </B>some bugs and adds monochrome display support.<P>
<I>dinkum3</I> is the latest revision in the Australian text adventure<B> </B>game series from Gary Allen <I>&lt;gary@sun.mech.uq.oz.au&gt;</I>. Posted<B> </B>in Volume 17, Issues 6-12, version 2.12 fixes several bugs and<B> </B>includes extensive revisions. Patch 1, with portability fixes for<B> </B>Macs and Coherent, was issued in Volume 17, Issues 35 and 36.<P>
The other big release this time is a new revision of Galactic<B> </B>Blodshed, called <I>gbp</I> for Galactic Blodshed+. Contributed by<B> </B>John Deragon <I>&lt;deragon@harpo.cs.nyu.edu&gt;</I>, it also entails a<B> </B>change in authors to the <I>gb</I><I>+</I> development team. Posted in<B> </B>Volume 17, Issues 13-33, the entire installation and<B> </B>configuration script has been redesigned for this release.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01A4_009B">Previews from <B><I>alt.sources</I><A name="01A4_009B"></B></FONT></h4></P>
As usual, plenty in <I>alt.sources</I>, so here are just a few<B> </B>highlights of what's to come in the main stream groups.<P>
Al <I>&lt;rbc!al&gt;</I> posted the ACS circuit simulator in 20 parts on<B> </B>January 25, 1993. ACS is an interactive circuit simulator for both<B> </B>analog and digital circuits. It performs nonlinear DC and<B> </B>transient analyses, fourier analysis, and AC<B> </B>analysis linearized at an operating point.<B> </B>It is fully interactive and<B> </B>command-driven. It can also be run in batch mode<B> </B>that is mostly Spice-compatible, so it is<B> </B>often possible to use the same file for<B> </B>both ACS and Spice. Spice-compatible<B> </B>models for the MOSFET (level 2) and<B> </B>diode are included in this release. Other<B> </B>models (MOSFET levels 1 and 3 and<B> </B>BJT) are in the testing phase.<P>
Lance Norskog <I>&lt;thinman@netcom.com&gt;</I><B> </B>posted his ST, sound tools, package in eight<B> </B>parts (0-7) on February 8, 1993. ST translates<B> </B>sound samples between different file formats,<B> </B>and performs various sound effects. This<B> </B>release understands raw files in various<B> </B>binary formats<B></B> &#151; Sound Blaster <I>.VOC</I> files,<B> </B>IRCAM SoundFile files, SUN Sparcstation<B> </B><I>.</I><I>au</I> files, mutant DEC <I>.au</I> files, Apple/SGI<B> </B>AIFF files, Macintosh HCOM files, Sounder<B> </B>files, and Soundtool (DOS) files. The sound<B> </B>effects include changing the sample rate,<B> </B>adding echo delay lines, applying low- and<B> </B>band-pass filtering, and the infamous Fender<B> </B>Vibro effect.<P>
Sam Lantinga <I>&lt;slantin@swrl36.calstate.edu&gt;</I><B> </B>posted <I>splitsh</I> on<B> </B>February 22, 1993 in one part. <I>splitsh</I><B> </B>splits the screen into two windows, each<B> </B>with its own shell, so you can do two<B> </B>things at once.<P>
