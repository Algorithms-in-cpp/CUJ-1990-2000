<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01BC_00A3">Koyn Software Releases New Library<A name="01BC_00A3"></FONT></h4></P>
Koyn Software has released Exceptions for C, a library that provides exception handling for ANSI C compilers. Exceptions for C supports a uniform exception handling mechanism, resembling that of Ada, that allows users to remove the bulk of error handling code from the code handling normal cases.<P>
To use Exceptions for C, a programmer compiles and links <I>XCEPT.C</I> into the program and <I>#includes XCEPT.H</I> in source files that use Exceptions for C. Three keywords are used to delineate use of exceptions: <I>xc_with_handling, xc_on_exception</I>, and <I>xc_end_exception</I>. Code for normal cases is placed after <I>xc_with_handling</I>, and exception handling code is placed after <I>xc_on_exception</I>. Handlers that don't recognize a particular exception can invoke <I>xc_reraise()</I><B>,</B> to pass the exception ot the next handler in the calls stack. <I>xc_cleanup</I> and <I>xc_end_cleanup</I>, can be used to mark code that executes normally and whether there has been an exception or not.<P>
The package includes the library (provided as ANSI C source code) and documentation in the header file. Exceptions for C is available in MS-DOS and Macintosh formatted disks, at $30 for a single copy. A site license is available for $30 for the first user plus $6 for each additional user, minimum 5 users. Contact <I>Koyn Software, 1754 Sprucedale, St. Louis, MO 63146, (314) 878-9725.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01BC_00A4">Software Migration Ports Xlib to DOS<A name="01BC_00A4"></FONT></h4></P>
Software Migration has released X/DOS, a DOS implementation of Xlib, the C interface for X. X/DOS allows X developers to port UNIX X clients to DOS. The programming interface of X/DOS is identical to Xlib. No changes to Xlib GUI calls are required when a program is ported to DOS.<P>
X/DOS is distributed as a DOS-linkable library. A UNIX C client can be recompiled and linked with X/DOS to create a standard DOS application than runs on a standalone PC. No special operating environment or X server is required. X/DOS provides a cross-development tool to create graphic applications that are portable between DOS and UNIX. X/DOS supports all X drawing capabilities and X events. Several fonts are supplied with X/DOS, and standard X fonts may be used.<P>
Prices for X/DOS begin at $295. Educational version of X/DOS are available for $99. Contact <I>Software Migration, 9 Commodore Dr., Suite 404, Emeryville, CA 94608, (510) 658-5436.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01BC_00A5">Media Cybernetics Releases Imaging Library<A name="01BC_00A5"></FONT></h4></P>
Media Cybernetics has released the HALO Imaging Library, a platform-independent library that lets C programmers add imaging capabilities to their applications. HALO Imaging Library gives developers 100 imaging functions and commands, allowing them to develop C programs that can read and store image files in several file formats, and perform various processing functions on images in memory.<P>
The HALO Imaging Library is divided into several functional groups: Image Management Functions to create and manage images in memory; Image Conversion Functions to convert images from one class to another; Image Enhancement Functions to adjust and refine brightness, contrast, and gamma characteristics, and to enhance an image with special effects such as blur, pixelize, sculpt, emboss, and overlay; Image Transformation Functions to rotate, transpose, flip, or spatially distort and image; Image File Format Functions to read and write image files including TIFF, JPG, GIF, TGA, PCX, BMP, CUT, EPS (write only), and PICT.<P>
HALO Imaging Library is available for MS-Windows, OS/2, Macintosh, UNIX/Motif, and UNIX/OPEN LOOK. The library contains an application program and source code samples that demonstrate the functions, along with platform-specific image display and print routines.<P>
A single workstation license for HALO Imaging Library for Windows is $595. Other platform versions are planned for release. Contact <I>Media Cybernetics, 8484 Georgia Ave., Silver Spring, MD 20910, (301) 495-3305; FAX: (301) 495-5964.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01BC_00A6">Alydaar Offers Translation Service<A name="01BC_00A6"></FONT></h4></P>
Alydaar Software Corporation has offered a service for translating source code between programming languages. Alydaar can translate C to Ada, COBOL to C/C++, Jovial to Ada, Pascal to C++, FORTRAN to C, RPG2/3 to COBOL, FORTRAN to Ada, and 370 BAL to C. Alydaar also permits migration between operating systems. Alydaar's translation technology is language independent and Alydaar claims typical translation rates of a million lines in three weeks.<P>
Alydaar technology is based on Algebraic and functional programming systems and is modeled after the symbolic manipulators designed to facilitate mathematic manipulations. Alydaar lets the users construct descriptions of each portion of the source language. This model accommodates information such as left/right associativity of operators and also operator precedence, adicness (monadic, dyadic, and triadic), operands, data conversion issues, type conversion issues, structural and elementary levels, and language addressing differences present in the implied abstract machine. The translator augmentation process uses a high-level, rule-based language.<P>
Alydaar supports: macro preprocessing, white space management, and comment processing; identification of expressional issues, description of statement level topics, and execution-time statements; resolution of declaration issues; and teaching the translator context syntax and semantics.<P>
Other features of Alydaar include: detailed specification of optimization and code-generation issues; saving interactive context for later use or compiling it into a C or Ada application; and target source code. Alydaar translation costs range from 25 to 50 cents per line translated. Contact <I>Alydaar Software Corporation, 216 Crown St., Suite 502A, New Haven, CT 06510, (203) 787-2544; FAX (203) 787-1440.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01BC_00A7">Hyperception Releases C Code Generator<A name="01BC_00A7"></FONT></h4></P>
Hyperception, Inc. has released Hypersignal-Windows Block Code Generator v1.0, a C code generator designed to work with the visually-programmed Hypersignal-Windows Block Diagram program. Using the code generator, users can simulate and test algorithms, and generate C code to run the algorithms outside the Block Diagram.<P>
To implement a DSP design, Block Diagram proves the algorithm, debugs it, and sets up "what-if" situations in a visual environment. The code generator then produces C code for the algorithm, which may be compiled with the DSP chip manufacturer's C compiler. This enables the program to run real-time on a DSP. Previously, such capability was typically found on workstations.<P>
Hypersignal-Windows Block Code Generator is available for $2995. Contact <I>Hyperception, Inc., 9550 Skillman, LB 125, Dallas, TX 75243, (214) 343-8525; FAX: (214) 343-2457.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01BC_00A8">DataDraw Releases Graphical Data Structure Toolkit<A name="01BC_00A8"></FONT></h4></P>
DataDraw has released a graphical data structure toolkit for Windows and DOS developers using C or C++. Using DataDraw, developers design data structures by drawing schemas. The DataDraw schema editor runs under MS-Windows v3.0 and can define objects along with their properties and relationships. Once a set of data structures has been represented, the editor will create C files that define and support all objects and their methods. Constant time memory management and data access through pointers are supported through an interface that hides implementation-specific details.<P>
Besides creating methods for building and traversing relationships, DataDraw also creates binary-file load and save functions. DataDraw includes code-generation source code, so users can customize DataDraw's output. DataDraw sells for $179 and comes with a 30-day, money-back guarantee. Contact <I>DataDraw, 1613 Butano Dr., Milpitas, CA 95035, BBS: (408) 956-0576.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="01BC_00A9">Software &amp; Consulting Releases DMalloc v1.0<A name="01BC_00A9"></FONT></h4></P>
Software &amp; Consulting has released DMalloc v1.0, a heap debugging and quality assurance tool for Microsoft C. DMalloc provides an overview and integrity checks of dynamically-allocated memory. DMalloc can be used to check memory allocations, without the need to recompile source code, by relinking the program with the DMalloc object file and the DMalloc library.<P>
DMalloc features include: automatically checking the heap when an allocation function is called; surrounding the allocated memory unit with "safeguards", so memory overwrites are detected but don't destroy the heap; cooperating with debuggers like CodeView and SoftICE in setting breakpoints; and identifying allocated memory units by source file and line of allocation. (Source modules must be recompiled to use this feature.) DMalloc can be popped up with the [PrtScreen] key to view status and examine or edit memory. DMalloc can be configured to reflect the working environment, during debugging, or by inserting calls to the DMalloc API into the program.<P>
DMalloc works with Microsoft C/C++ v5.1 or higher. The large memory model is required. DMalloc is marketed as shareware, and is available on CompuServe, through ASP-approved BBSes, and ASP-approved shareware vendors. The registered version of DMalloc is $47 and an unregistered evaluation disk is $5.
