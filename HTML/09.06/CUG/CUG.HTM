This volume contains a collection of small C utilities contributed by 12 authors. Most of the programs were developed under MS-DOS, but some programs are portable enough to be compiled under other operating systems. The disk includes complete C source code for all programs.<P>
Eric Horner (IL) has submitted XTAB (tab extraction utility), ITAB (tab insertion utility), PCON (multiple printer control codes), and MIND (mastermind game). The programs are portable, although they were developed under Turbo C v2.0.<P>
Michael Kelly (MA) has submitted functions for parsing a line of text into an array of strings, substring search in a string, and low-level primitives for quick screen output in text modes on IBM PC or compatible. He has also provided the demonstration programs using those functions, and Turbo Pascal source code indent utility. The programs were developed under Turbo C v1.5/2.0.<P>
Paul Ammann (CT) has submitted a pull-down menu demonstration program that was developed under Turbo C and uses a BGI file. The current setting works for CGA terminals.<P>
Ronald J. Terry (IL) has submitted various mathematical functions (<I>exp, ln</I>), which use fast converging series approximations, IBM video functions, DOS functions, and string functions. The programs were developed under Turbo C.<P>
Bryan R. Leipper (NV) has submitted a printer utility that prints input files to a printer with HP LJ II+ graphics. The program provides an extensive set of options to set margins, height of page, tab expansion, width of line, output direction, pages to print, the number of copies, page header and footer, and non-printable characters as underlined byte values. The program was compiled under Microsoft C v5.1.<P>
Vernon R. Martin (OH) has submitted a set of functions similar to BASIC functions, used when a C program must access to a BASIC data file or a BASIC program needs to be ported into C. The BASIC-like functions he has provided are <I>instr()</I> (in string) function, <I>mid(), right(), cvd()</I> and <I>ncvs()</I> that unpack packed double or single precision data into a double value, <I>mkd()</I> and <I>mks ()</I> that pack a double value into an eight- or four-character long string. In addition, he has given a couple of rounding routines. The programs were developed under XENIX C compiler or ECO C compiler.<P>
Adam Blum (VA) has contributed P2S, which converts <I>printf()</I> in C programs to C++ streams formatted I/O (&lt; operator). It handles width and precision flags (%-6.2f) by generating the appropriate streams manipulators &#151; <I>setw()</I> and <I>setprecision()</I>. The source code is a <I>lex</I> source file, thus you need Flex (CUG #290) to compile the program.<P>
Bill Forseth (MN) has contributed MTX, which solves a matrix A|b form using Gauss-Jordan elimination. Compared to other numerous G-J programs, this program uses dynamic allocation of memory and executes quick. Turbo C v2.0 was used to develop the program.<P>
Michael Wiedmann (Germany) has contributed a set of functions to access the resident portion of <I>PRINT. COM</I> in MS-DOS. By using those functions in an application program, a user can print from the application, stop printing and resuming printing. The program was developed under Microsoft C v5.1/ 6.0.<P>
D.N. Holland (PA) responded to Enghert's mail in the CUJ December 1990 issue and rewrote CFLOW that prints a C function tree in input C source code. The new CFLOW provides more features such as adding line numbers, wild cards and 'f' flag that is used to find the first level functions only. He also provided the modification of CB and XC2 programs in CUG#236.<P>
Conrad Thornton (LA) has submitted a set of functions to manipulate a circular que. Any size and any data type can be stored in the que. Those functions can be used for event trapping.<P>
