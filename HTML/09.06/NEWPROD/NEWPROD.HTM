<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0165_00BC">Certification Program<B></B> <B></B>For Compatibility Established<A name="0165_00BC"></FONT></h4></P>
Several major C library companies and Rational Systems are announcing a certification program that checks compatibility between new releases of C library products and new releases of Rational's development tools, DOS/16M and Instant-C.<P>
The library verification program allows Rational Systems and C library developers to work together to deliver reliable and fully compatible tools to C programmers. The C library vendors participating in the program include Copia, FairCom, MetaGraphics, Novell, Oakland, Raima, and Roundhill.<P>
The certification program also calls for joint-marketing projects to notify programmers about compatible products. Joint activities include bundling marketing literature, mailing list sharing and product bundle discounts through mail order distributors.<P>
For more information, <I>contact Rational Systems, 220 North Main St., Natick, MA 01760, (508) 653-6006; (508) 655-2753.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0165_00BD">Microsoft C V6.0 Assists Developers<B></B> <B></B>Of Windows Applications<A name="0165_00BD"></FONT></h4></P>
Microsoft has announced two new tools for Microsoft C Professional Development System v6.0. One is a single-monitor version of the CodeView for Windows debugger. It allows developers of applications for the Microsoft Windows graphical environment to choose between dual monitor and single-monitor debugging. The second, an extended-memory compiler supporting both DPMI (DOS Protected Mode Interface) and VCPI (Virtual Control Program Interface) DOS extenders, offers a solution for applications that are too large to be compiled in conventional memory.<P>
Windows developers can now debug their applications with only one monitor, using a single key to toggle the display between the application and the CodeView debugger. This approach avoids cluttering the Windows screen with debugging information, allowing the developer to see the Windows screen as the user will see it. Developers still have the option of using two monitors for debugging if they prefer.<P>
To overcome capacity limitations during compilation, Microsoft has enhanced the compiler with the ability to use several types of extended memory. This approach allows Windows developers to remain in the Windows environment throughout the development process.<P>
The compiler can take advantage of a variety of memory extenders, including DPMI servers, such as Windows; VCPI systems, such as the Quarterdeck Office Systems QEMM or Qualitas 386-Max; and HIMEM.SYS. Its built-in intelligence lets it determine the type of memory environment that is present and select the best mode of compiling for that environment. If the compiler finds no memory extender, it will run on a 640K machine, just as the previous C compiler did.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0165_00BE">C Library Offers PostScript Support<A name="0165_00BE"></FONT></h4></P>
Barton Creek Software has released <I><B>c_pslib</I></B>, an ANSI C language development library for creating PostScript output. The library contains the tools to create PostScript output from any C application without learning the PostScript language.<P>
The library implements PostScript calls at three levels of support. It contains functions to add your own PostScript procedures and call the primitive PostScript procedures directly. <I><B>c_pslib</I></B> provides a mid-level interface to handle text, graphics, and loops through a C interface. For those programmers who don't know PostScript, <I><B>c_pslib</I></B> has a high-level interface that takes care of all the PostScript for you.<P>
Through a tightly joined interplay between the C function calls and the procedures, definitions, and variables within the PostScript document, <I><B>c_pslib</I></B> gives the programmer complete control over the output without tracking current points, linewidths, and gray levels, so common to the development of applications with good PostScript support.<P>
