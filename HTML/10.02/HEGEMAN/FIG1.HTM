 [0]   The sign.
 [1]   An integer portion of i factorial-base digits.
  |    The value of [n] ranges from 0 to n, The value
 [i]   of the integer portion is ?*1! + ?*2! + ... + ?*i!
 [G]   A guard to detect integer overflow.
 [G+1] Records carrys &amp; borrows during normalization.
 [G+2] A fractional portion of f-1 factorial-base digits.
  |    The value of [n] ranges from 0 to n-1. The value
 [G+f] of the fraction is ?/2! + ?/3! + ... + ?/f!
 [G2]  A guard to detect fractional underflow.</pre>
