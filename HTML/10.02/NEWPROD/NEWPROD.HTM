<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="008A_0031">Supercomputer For The 90s<A name="008A_0031"></FONT></h4></P>
Cray Research, Inc. has introduced a parallel vector computer system, the CRAY Y-MP C90 supercomputer. The system has 16 central processing units (CPUs), and on actual customer problems, operates four times the speed of Cray Research's previous fastest supercomputers.<P>
The CRAY Y-MP C90 system features a CPU with a peak performance of one billion floating-point operations per second (Gflop/s). With 16 of these powerful CPUs and 256 megawords (2 gigabytes) of central memory, the CRAY Y-MP C90 system has a peak performance of 16 Gflop/s.<P>
The CRAY Y-MP C90 system uses a balanced parallel, vector-scalar architecture to maximize sustained performance. A significant feature of the CRAY Y-MP C90 system is a dual-vector pipeline that allows each of the system's 16 CPUs to deliver two vector results per functional unit every clock period. With its 64-way parallelism and efficient multiprocessing capabilities, the CRAY Y-MP C90 system can deliver a total of 64 vector results per clock period, or four times that of Cray Research's previous top-end systems.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="008A_0032">New Generation Of Anti-virus Software<A name="008A_0032"></FONT></h4></P>
Fifth Generation Systems, Inc. has released Untouchable, a line of anti-virus software that provides virus protection without the need for frequent virus signature updates. Untouchable stand-alone and network products are designed to operate on DOS-based PCs, compatibles, and networks.<P>
Untouchable consists of three distinct anti-virus technologies that constantly interact to detect and eradicate known and unknown viruses. The file scanner incorporates the principal of modification detection. This mathematically-proven technique safeguards against known and unknown virus threats by making use of file signatures rather than the commonly-used virus signatures. A TSR monitor checks system memory for known boot sector and partition table viruses.<P>
In addition, a virus scanner/remover can detect and eradicate hundreds of known viruses.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="008A_0033">Untouchable Network<A name="008A_0033"></FONT></h4></P>
Untouchable Network provides Novell LAN administrators with the ability to centrally monitor and control the entire network for viruses<P>
The program uses the same methods of protection as the stand-alone version, but incorporates enhanced LAN management features. Untouchable Network currently provides its enhanced LAN management facilities for the Novell Netware operating system. A network savvy version of the product, without the LAN management features, is available to run on Microsoft LAN Manager, Banyan Vines, 3Com, and other PC network operating systems.<P>
Untouchable is available for $165. An Untouchable Network Starter Kit is available for $695. The starter kit includes the server package of full supervisor documentation and software and ten node license agreements. License agreements for additional nodes may be purchased for $85 per node.<P>
While Untouchable does not require virus signature updates to ensure complete protection against undiscovered new viruses, Fifth Generation Systems recognizes that some users may want them. The company will provide quarterly virus signature updates for the virus scanner and TSR monitor, for a service charge of $15 per quarter.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="008A_0034">ROMable Operating System<A name="008A_0034"></FONT></h4></P>
Datalight has released a new version of ROM-DOS, the small, low-cost, modifiable operating system that can run from within ROM or on a floppy or hard disk. The new version of ROM-DOS is compatible with MS-DOS v3.31 and has many added features such as support for Datalight FLASH Memory Disk, Installable File Systems, configurable memory disks and hard disks up to 512 Megabytes.<P>
ROM-DOS compatibility with common desktop DOS has been certified and documented by VeriTest, an independent testing agency. VeriTest successfully ran a collection of 28 widely used MS-DOS applications under ROM-DOS, including: AutoCAD, dBASE IV, Freelance Plus, Lotus 1-2-3, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Works, Multimate, Paradox, R:BASE, Sidekick, Turbo Pascal, Ventura Publisher, and Word Perfect.<P>
ROM-DOS allows a developer to write the application program in the desired language, then convert the program into a ROMable EXE (named RXE) that will execute the code directly from ROM. The RXE is loaded into ROM along with ROM-DOS to run in the target system with no further modifications required. Developers can place the memory intensive program code in ROM and use valuable RAM space only for the remaining program data.<P>
ROM-DOS resides in about 34K ROM, and uses as little as 10K RAM when running. ROM-DOS can be further minimized when customized to include only specifically needed functions. ROM-DOS can also be run with Datalight's mini-BIOS which requires less than 3K of ROM. The ROM-DOS Developer's Kit contains the tools and utilities needed to port ROM-DOS to the developer's choice of hardware platform. Also included are numerous DOS utilities, source code for all device drivers, and source code for the mini-BIOS.<P>
ROM-DOS can be purchased in quantity for as low as $5 per copy. The Developer's Kit is available for $495. License to the source code is available for $10,000. For more information <I>contact Datalight, 17455 - 68th Ave NE, Suite 304, Bothell, WA 98011, 1-800-221-6630</I>.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="008A_0036">Improved Laser Printer Output And Mouse Event-driven GUI's<A name="008A_0036"></FONT></h4></P>
Clarion Software is now shipping v4. 1 of its Graphics Language Extension Module (LEM) for the Clarion Professional Developer. Version 4.1 improves that quality of output to laser printers and allows users to create mouse event-driven graphical user interfaces (GUIs).<P>
Version 4.1 of the Graphics LEM provides functions that allow users to print full-page, 300 dpi vector output to Hewlett-Packard LaserJet Series III and PostScript printers, eliminating jagged lines and enhancing graphics resolution. Version 4.1 also is better equipped to handle .PCX images. An updated function correctly sets the color palette from the header of the .PCX file and allows the display of .PCX images larger than the screen. New functions also now allow users to remap the standard Graphics LEM 16 colors to any color supported by the EGA or VGA card in use. For instance, to display a .PCX image that has eight shades of blue, users can remap 8 of the 16 colors to the various shades of blue. Though users may continue to display only a maximum of 16 colors, these colors can range outside the standard Graphics LEM color palette.<P>
The simplify creation of GUIs, 4.1 of the Graphics LEM can save and restore partial graphics screens to create popdown, tile, icon, and many other screen styles, all using only the Graphics LEM's capabilities. Another new function identifies a rectangular area of the screen as an active clipping region. Parts of objects extending outside the designated area are not drawn. New vector printing functions allow users to print only the "clipped" area of the screen.<P>
Version 4.1 also includes a number of new and improved utilities and fonts. Utilities allow users to debug .PCX-based image-handling applications, improve the look of applications, speed application design, and allow for more flexible handling of custom created or edited fonts.<P>
Enhancements to the GFONT icon and font editor allow users to map fonts to equivalent fonts native on PostScript or Hewlett-Packard LaserJet Series III printers. They also provide improved scaling capabilities. The ability to import a .PCX file to create new icons or fonts also has been improved.<P>
Included in the new graphics functions is a 3-D "caged" bar-chart function that creates a 3-D rendering of a "caged" background. The ability to display a time-series graph also has been improved. For first-time buyers, v4.1 of the Graphics LEM is priced at $199. Current registered users of the Graphics LEM can upgrade for $50. For registered users who purchased the product on July 1, 1991, or later, the upgrade is free.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="008A_003D">C++ Version Of Linpack Announced<A name="008A_003D"></FONT></h4></P>
Rogue Wave Software, Inc. announces today that it has started shipping two new C++ class libraries, Matrix.h++ and Linpack.h++. These new C++ class libraries extend the C++ language to include numerical algorithms that were previously available only in FORTRAN.<P>
Linpack.h++ is an object-oriented C++ version of the widely used FORTRAN library. Linpack.h++ includes 100% of the functionality of the FORTRAN version, plus much more. Because Linpack.h++ is written in C++ it has capabilities that far exceed the FORTRAN version.<P>
Rogue Wave's new libraries take full advantage of C++'s strengths: operator overloading, object-orientation, and speed. Programmer productivity is boosted because you work with whole objects that represent numerical data rather than low-level "DO" loops. The result is fewer, but more expressive, lines of code. Both Matrix.h++ and Linpack.h++ are completely compatible with Rogue Wave's other C++ class libraries, Tools.h++ and Math.h++. Matrix.h++ and Linpack.h++ are available for most machines, from MS-DOS to UNIX, including a vectorized version for the CRAY. Matrix.h++ includes all the functionality of Math.h++. Matrix.h++ adds specialized matrix classes such as banded, symmetric, positive-definite, Hermitian, tridiagonal, etc. Because Matrix.h++ includes Math.h++, it can take advantage of Math.h++'s optimized lowlevel assembly routines.<P>
Linpack.h++ includes all of Matrix.h++, plus all of the functionality in the original and well-established FORTRAN version; including solutions of systems of equations for a variety of matrix types, solutions of over- and under-determined systems or equations, incremental least squares solvers, etc. But, Linpack.h++ is a true object-oriented library, not just a C version that compiles under C++: the FORTRAN version has been replaced with high-level objects.<P>
The classes are available now. Prices range from $199 to $995 for Matrix.h++ and $299 to $1195 for Linpack.h++. For more information <I>contact Rogue Wave Software Inc., 1325 NW 9th Street, Corvallis, OR 97330, (503) 757-2311</I>.<P>
