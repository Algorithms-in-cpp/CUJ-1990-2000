<BLOCKQUOTE>
Resident libraries are a dynamic mechanism facilitated by the AMIGA-DOS Executive. These libraries are linked at runtime contrary to the normal compile, link cycle that links a runtime library object module into a binary executable at link time. This runtime linking is not truly a link but rather a jumptable that jumps to a relative offset from the libraries' base pointer. The base pointer is returned from the <I>OpenLibrary()</I> call.<P>
<h4>Advantages</FONT></h4></P>
There are three big advantages to a resident library:<P>
1. Using resident libraries, you can reduce the size of executable files because the object code necessary for a particular function is contained in the resident library. Also, when more than one task is operating in memory there is not duplicated code taking up precious memory.<P>
2. It takes less time to load an executable because part of the executable is already in RAM memory. When there are several tasks multitasking, the AMIGA-DOS Executive keeps a list of libraries. Subsequent tasks that try to access a particular library that is already on the list are speeded up by the executive looking at the list and seeing that it is already resident.<P>
3. There is true runtime versioning control on the library themselves. The <I>OpenLibrary(char *LibName</I>,<I> </I><I>long</I><I> </I><I>Version)</I> system call allows programs at runtime to specify a version number that the present library must be equal to or greater than to have a successful open. If versioning is not required, a version of <I>0</I> as an argument to the <I>OpenLibrary</I> call will allow whatever version is present.<P>
<h4>Typical AMIGA DOS 1.3 LIBS</FONT></h4></P>
<I>arp.library</I> is obtainable through most BBS's such as BIX, COMPUSERVE and PEOPLES LINK. It falls into the "freeware" category since it is copyrighted by ARP Authors (represented by Microsmith's Inc. It contains a multitude of functions that allow a programmer and/or user more capability then the corresponding AMIGA DOS 1.3 library functions might.)<P>
