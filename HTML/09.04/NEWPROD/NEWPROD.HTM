<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00C2_0083">FORTRAN Compiler For C-based Platforms<A name="00C2_0083"></FONT></h4></P>
Promula Development Corporation announced an enhanced FORTRAN compiler for C-based platforms. Version 3.0 of Promula. Fortran is a multi-dialect and multi-platform compiler that will process FORTRAN codes of almost any dialect on almost any platform that supports a standard C compiler.<P>
Promula.Fortran supports both the FORTRAN 6 and the FORTRAN 77 standards and almost all existing FORTRAN dialects: VAX VMS, IBM VS, PDP-11, PRIME FTN and F77, SUN F77, and Honeywell FORTRAN. It also supports a number of FORTRAN 90 features, such as structures and pointer variables. Moreover, it has a dialect definition file that allows you to configure the compiler for features not included in the default dialect definition.<P>
No matter how old or extended your FORTRAN dialect is, Promula will process it by first compiling it to C. Promula.Fortran translates FORTRAN code to clean, portable, and maintainable C code while allowing extensive control over the translation process. The resultant C code can then be compiled via any standard C compiler and linked with the Promula.Fortran runtime library to produce efficient executable code, which produces the same results on a target platform as the original code on the source platform.<P>
Promula. Fortran is available for several platforms, including IBM PC, Apple Macintosh, VAX/VMS, VAX/Ultrix, SUN/UNIX, IBM/AIX, and other UNIX workstations, as well as IBM mainframes. Prices start at $995 for a single-user PC license. Multi-user, cross-compiler, and multi-platform licenses are also available.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00C2_0084">CodeWatch V5.0<A name="00C2_0084"></FONT></h4></P>
Language Processors is now offering CodeWatch v5.0, a window-based release of LPI's interactive source-level debugger. The new windowed interface displays source program and program output simultaneously, while allowing the developer to enter commands.<P>
CodeWatch windowing provides easy interaction with the debugger. Developers have access to CodeWatch commands through menus and dialogs, and they can choose either CodeWatch/X or CodeWatch/CH.<P>
CodeWatch/X displays a graphical-based interface that uses all the capabilities of the Motif user interface and X Window. The Source window displays the current source file, allowing the user to scroll, search, and set breakpoints. The Command window allows the user to type in commands that are saved and can be viewed during the debugging session by scrolling the window. User program output goes to the terminal window. User program output goes to the terminal window from which CodeWatch/X is invoked.<P>
CodeWatch/CH provides a character-based interface that can run on any ASCII terminal, without a graphical windowing system. CodeWatch/CH offers the same two windows as CodeWatch/X: Source and Command. It also provides a program output window to display user program output.<P>
CodeWatch v5.0 supports LPI's FORTRAN, C, PL/I, Cobol, BASIC, and Pascal languages, initially on 386, 486, SPARC, and Sun 3 architectures running UNIX. For more information, <I>contact Language Processors, 959 Concord St., Framingham, MA 01701-4613, (508) 626-0006; FAX (508) 626-2221.</I><P>
