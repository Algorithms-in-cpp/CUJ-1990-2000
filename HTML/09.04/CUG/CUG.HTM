David Kotz (NC), one of gnuplot modifiers, has provided the v2.02 update of "gnuplot". The update includes the support of new commands (<I>cd</I> and <I>pwd</I>), new terminal and printer drivers (Epson 60dpi printer, Tandy DMP-130 printer, Star color printer, emTeX, AT&amp;T 6300, Tektronix 410x, X11, HP LaserJet II, VT like Tektronix emulator, Kyocera Laser printer and SCO CGI), parametric functions, X11 Motif support, and new bit-mapped graphics routines.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00C0_0080">CUG337 Designing Screen Interfaces in C<A name="00C0_0080"></FONT></h4></P>
This volume contains the source code that appeared in the book, "Designing Screen Interfaces in C" written by James Pinson and distributed by Prentice Hall. The disk includes C source code for screen/window functions such as pop-up menus, moving light bar menus, multi-level moving light bar menus, pull-down menus, data input screens, list selection, directory functions, context-specific help screens, help screen builder, and Turbo C project files. The code will compile under all memory models of Turbo C and Quick C.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00C0_0081">CUG338 68000 C Compiler and Assembler<A name="00C0_0081"></FONT></h4></P>
Brian Brown (New Zealand) has submitted the complete package of the cross development tools for MS-DOS systems. The package includes the 68000 C compiler, which was adapted from CUG#204 68K C compiler written by Matthew Brandt, and an assembler, which was also adapted from CUG#261 68K cross assembler written by Steve Passe and modified by Stuart Dole. The compiler uses both intermediate and peephole optimization and generates very efficient 68000 assembly code. It accepts floating point types but doesn't know how to deal with them. The preprocessor supports only <I>#include</I> and <I>#define</I>. There is no standard runtime library support. The assembler accepts the output from the C compiler and generates <I>.LS</I> file (list) and <I>.S19</I> file (Motorola S record). The <I>.S19</I> file is downloaded to a target system for operation. The disk includes the C source code, documentation, and MS-DOS executable code for both compiler and assembler. The source code will compile under Turbo C. Currently, no commercial use of the programs is allowed.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00C0_0082">CUG339 CTRLCLIB<A name="00C0_0082"></FONT></h4></P>
William Letendre (NJ) has submitted a shareware package, "CTRLCLIB &#151; The Ctrl+C Library". CTRLCLIB is a collection of C functions to help programmers to manage user-inititated interrupts &#151; those keystrokes users make that "crash" less robust programs. CTRCLIB traps interrupts such as control-C and control-break and also suppresses the insidious "^C", which disrupts screen displays. Other functions from the library can detect control-alt-del (reboot), disable the pause key, provide full control to all lock keys (caps lock and num lock), and much more. There is even a function to force a warm or cold reboot. This shareware disk includes small and large memory model libraries for Microsoft C v5.1 and v6.0, Quick C v2.5, Turbo C v2.0, and Turbo C++ vl.0, and includes sample demo programs. To obtain the C source code for the program, you may contact the author at Trendtech Corporation, 14 Ella Lane, Wayne, NY 07470.<P>
