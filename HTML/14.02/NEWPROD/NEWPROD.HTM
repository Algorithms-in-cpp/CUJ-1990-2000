               <h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Kuck &amp; Associates Announces Photon C++ Compiler</FONT></H4>
               
               <P>Kuck &amp; Associates has announced
                    the Photon C++ compiler, an optimizing compiler for C++
                    applications. Photon C++ has optimizations that allow
                    developers to use object-oriented design all the way into
                    the kernels. </P>
               
               <P> Photon C++ optimizes several
                    paradigms used in object-oriented programming. Photon C++
                    automatically optimizes lightweight objects (objects that
                    are created, used, and destroyed frequently), data
                    abstractions (allowing the programmer to leave them in
                    object-oriented form), and control flow to the most
                    efficient form (allowing structured control flow to be
                    maintained). Photon C++ eliminates redundant tests, allowing
                     self-checking member functions to be used efficiently.
                    </P>

               <P>ParaSoft Corporation has released
                    Insure++, a run-time debugger for C and C++ programs. During
                    compilation, Insure++ inserts test and analysis functions
                    around every line of source code. It builds a database of
                    all program elements, including data structures, memory
                    usage, pointer usage and interfaces. At run time, Insure++
                    checks each data value and memory reference against its
                    database to verify consistency and correctness. As memory
                    management commands such as malloc, new, delete, and free
                    are executed, Insure++ updates the memory usage database.
                    Source code encapsulation ensures that Insure++ can detect
                    every memory reference error and a wide variety of other
                    programming errors automatically, as the program executes.
                    </P>
               
               <P> Insure++ for Windows NT and Windows
                    95 is priced from $499 for a single user. Versions of
                    Insure++ for other platforms are also available. </P>

                    it will provide cost-free evaluation copies of CAD/CAM
                    Developer's Kit/2D C function library. The CAD/CAM
                    Developer's Kit/2D is a C function library that supports
                    core CAD/CAM operations, including geometry construction
                    (lines, arcs, circles, ellipses, and NURB splines),
                    wireframe display, and reading and writing DXF-format CAD
                    data files. </P>
               
               <P> The library is an ANSI-standard C
                    source code foundation for CAD/CAM-related software
                    applications, such as hidden line removal, parametric
                    programs, toolpath computation, and design analysis. In
                    addition to source code and on-line documentation, the
                    product comes with ready-to-run sample programs for Windows
                    3.1, Windows NT, Windows 95, DOS, and UNIX. </P>
               
               <P> The current retail price of the
                    package with printed documentation is $999. Users of the
                    special edition library will be eligible to purchase printed
                    documentation for $199. </P>

                    DLL 1.4, a Windows library of 16-bit graphics and database
                    functions. These functions allow you to manage a graphic
                    window that provides pan, zoom, overview, and copy buttons;
                    display raster images (BMP, RLE, RLC) on which you can
                    overlay vector drawings (DWG, WMF, and DBCAD dev Graphic
                    DBF); print graphic images (raster and vector) and text
                    using standard Windows drivers and fonts; and import (from
                    DXF and DWG files), create, select, and edit all the AutoCAD
                    2-D vector entities (points, lines, arcs, blocks, text,
                    etc.), including properties (color, layer, linetype). These
                    entities are stored in a graphic database (standard DBF)
                    with an associated identfier that can be used for linking
                    with alphanumeric database records (in any database format
                    that your programming language can support). </P>

                    directly to the c-tree Plus application programming
                    interface (API). All of the program logic necessary to
                    handle requests from a front-end application is contained
                    within the driver itself, including an SQL interpreter. The
                    ODBC-compliant application uses the FairCom Driver to access
                    c-tree Plus data files via c-tree Plus or the FairCom
                    Server. The ODBC Driver is a dynamic link library (DLL) that
                    supports three operational modes of c-tree Plus:
                    single-user, multi-user non-server, and client/server.
                    </P>
               
               <P> The FairCom ODBC Driver is comprised
                    of an ODBC Driver Kit that starts at $395. The subsequent
                    ODBC generated DLLs may then be deployed for $49 per node.
