          <BLOCKQUOTE><p>I'm going through complexity shock
               again. That seems to be a theme that recurs ever more frequently
               these days. Time was, I could spend maybe a month out of the year
               studying the latest technology and deciding which bits were worth
               mastering. Then I'd just go and master them. Now it seems I keep
               studying more and mastering less with each passing month.</p>
               
               <P>At the moment, I have two computers
                    more or less running Windows95. The "more" part is that
                    the OS definitely occupies more disk real estate, and eats
                    more compute cycles. The "less" part is that fewer things
                    work right than when I was just fooling around with that
                    old-fashioned Windows 3.1 I've used for years. Yes, I've
                    read all those "100 Tips" articles. And yes, I've tapped 
                    my (scant) sources at Microsoft for some critical hand
                    holding. But no, I can't say I've made much progress.</P>
               
               <P>All those wizards keep getting in my
                    way. When they guess right, they perform minor miracles for
                    the uninformed, I suppose. But when they don't, they really
                    mess up. Then they leave mysterious wreckage lying about
                    that usually forces me to reinstall everything yet again. At
                    the best of times, they introduce enough rock wool between
                    me and what's really going on to insulate a New England 
                    colonial farm house. Just tell me what the parameters are
                    and how I can set them, please. Don't protect me from
                    knowing what's going on.</P>
               
               <P>A scant ten years ago, I knew every
                    byte of code in the computers I used. If I hadn't written it
                    myself, people in my company did, writing in a style and to
                    specifications over which I had some semblance of control.
                    Now I am reduced to working in tiny pockets that I have
                    carved out of the hektomegabytes of software I can't avoid
                    using. I am not yet a happy camper in this brave new world.</P>
               
               <P>I know that things will eventually get
                    better. I'll work out the usual minimal subset of
                    functionality I need - which will probably exercise about
                    two per cent of all those bytes squatting on the hard drive.
                    Right now I'm particularly grumpy. For the first time in my
                    career, I've had to rent a machine for a few months, just to
                    avoid installing a nontrivial OS on one of my own. I broke 
                    down last week and engaged the services of a network
                    consultant, rather than learn a chunk of technology that I
                    need more than I care to learn about. And I finally gave up
                    and ordered some new computers with Windows95 preinstalled.
                    Hardly the behavior of a nominal computer expert.</P>
               
               <P>Well, at least I still know a thing or
                    two about C and C++. But now there's this new language
                    called Java...</P>
