               <p>My principal activity this past month
                    has been something I call systems maintenance. At least
                    thats how I label the time I spend on this particular topic
                    in my work log. It consists of installing new hardware and
                    software, then learning enough about it so I can incorporate
                    it into my daily routine. I dont like to do this sort of
                    thing, which is why I confine most systems maintenance to 
                    one or two binges a year. The rest of the time, boxes of new
                    stuff sit around unopened for long stretches, driving my
                    family mildly nutty.</p>

               <p>What precipitated this particular
                    binge was the acquisition of several new computers, all
                    running Windows95. That completely alters how I network
                    computers in my home, how I shovel e-mail about, and darned
                    near everything else connected with sitting in front of an
                    SVGA display. There are lots of new interfaces to get
                    working. At the same time, I cut over from using Borlands 
                    C++ compiler to the latest offering from Microsoft. You can
                    imagine how off balance Ive been.</p>

               <p>Even though I dont like systems
                    maintenance, I have to admit that Im pretty good at it. Im
                    the same way about debugging. Getting stuck triggers all
                    sorts of conditioned reflexes. I rant and rave, wallowing in
                    despair. Then I take a deep breath and go back to work.
                    Sooner or later, the gadget starts to make sense, or the
                    source of the bug looms into view. The outcome is generally 
                    good, but the process is painful.</p>

               <p>Id probably be a lot more productive
                    if I learned to control some of those reflexes. Most of the
                    time I waste can be traced directly to lousy decisions made
                    while in a blue funk. More wasted time can be attributed to
                    procrastination if I didnt put such work off so long, it
                    probably wouldnt turn into such a major production each
                    time. I guess Im fortunate that writing code is mostly fun. 
                    Otherwise, I couldnt afford all those new computers.</p>

               <p>Each of us has our likes and dislikes,
                    which are not necessarily aligned exactly with our strengths
                    and weaknesses. As professionals, we have an obligation to
                    keep improving. (The obligation is to ourselves at least as
                    much as to our employers or clients.) What Ive learned this
                    past month is that improvement takes many forms besides the
                    acquisition of new knowledge. Sometimes, you make progress
                    just learning how to get your mind right.</p>
