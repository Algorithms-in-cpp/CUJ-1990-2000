               <p>Hypercube has released HyperView++ for
                    MFC v1.0, a class library for adding dialog/view editor
                    capability into an application. HyperView++ comes with a
                    base set of default objects and controls. Custom objects and
                    controls can be created easily for use within the editor and
                    at run time.</p>
               
               <p>The CHyperView class edits, creates,
                    and uses dialogs/views without recompiling; and creates new
                    custom objects using inheritance. Possible uses include
                    input dialogs, status views, custom views, report views, and
                    run-time flexibility.</p>
               
               <p>A demo is available for download and

                    terminal emulation APIs, ATERM, WinCGI, VBX APIs, and OLE
                    custom control (OCX) tools.</p>
               
               <p>NEWT-SDK 5.0 supports WinCGI via a
                    Visual Basic control. The WinCGI interface allows back-end
                    applications to be written for forms and image map support.
                    The ATERM API enables PC users to write applications to
                    access UNIX-based data through a telnet session. Both these
                    APIs help create applications that integrate legacy UNIX
                    applications with Windows front-end applications. Once 
                    complete, an application can be launched using the DLLs
                    included in the kit.</p>

               <p>IONA Technologies has released Orbix
                    2.0 for Windows NT and Windows 95, a product used to create
                    and control CORBA (Common Object Request Broker
                    Architecture) objects using desktop tools such as Visual
                    Basic 4.0. The Orbix 2.0 implementation of the Object
                    Management Groups (OMGs) CORBA standard allows development
                    of applications that run on 12 different UNIX flavors.</p>
               
               <p>Orbix 2.0 simplifies integration
                    between Windows and UNIX applications by creating CORBA
                    objects using OLE custom controls (OCXs) without the need
                    for extra programming. Orbix supplies previously
                    desktop-bound OLE objects with the ability to communicate
                    across the network with other OLE and CORBA objects.</p>
               
               <p>Orbix 2.0 along with Visual Basic 4.0
                    can generate OLE mapping code that allows any OLE-aware
                    application, such as Microsoft Excel, to be accessed by a

                    JPEG, TIFF, PCX, DCX, compressed and uncompressed Microsoft
                    Device Independent Bitmaps, comprehensive TIFF/CCITT group
                    3, and other formats. Color Generic Device Driver also
                    supports 42 standard American and European paper imaging 
                    sizes. After installation in a Windows environment, the
                    driver can be connected to either a fax port or a file port.
                    The driver provides 100x200 or 200x200 output to the fax
                    port, and 300x300 output to the file port.</p>

               <p>Segue Software, Inc. announced GO!, a
                    product that automatically creates routine tests, test
                    plans, and reports. GO! automatically creates tests without
                    writing a line of code. GO! automates the routine tests,
                    leaving more time for the difficult, impossible-to-automate
                    tests.</p>
               
               <p>GO! includes online Test Wizards that
                    provide step-by-step guidance, allowing users to create
                    tests, run the tests, and generate detailed reports on the
                    UI of the application being tested. The test scripts are
                    reusable. GO! generates application-specific test scripts
                    that automatically perform routine GUI tests such as
                    completeness of windows, attributes of graphical
                    user-interface controls, mnemonic clashes, tab order, list
                    box operations, and GUI control alignment. GO! requires the
                    QA Partner test tool, and the results can automatically
                    generate test plans within QA Planner.</p>

               <p>Innosoft International Inc. has
                    released PMDF for Digital UNIX, a UNIX version of its
                    Internet-style e-mail solution.</p>
               
               <p>In PMDF for Digital UNIX, the PMDF-MTA
                    (Message Transfer Agent) avoids the security problems in
                    sendmail. For example, PMDF does not run with root access,
                    making it difficult for an intruder to tamper with someones
                    mail or interrupt programs. PMDF also restricts use of the
                    mail system for executing UNIX commands on the host machine;
                    control remains in the hands of the system administrator 
                    thus eliminating command errors.</p>
               
               <p>PMDF-MTA can be interconnected with
                    other specialized messaging environments using additional
                    products such as PMDF-X400, a direct link to any
                    standards-based X.400 mail system, and PMDF-MB400, which
                    provides SMTP/MIME connectivity specifically to Digitals
                    MAILbus 400 system.</p>
               
               <p>Software licensing fees for a typical
                    installation will range from $8,000 to $15,000 or more,
                    depending upon the level of PMDF functionality selected for

               <h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Amzi! Logic Server
               Adds ODBC Access</FONT></H4>
               
               <p>Amzi! has added ODBC support to its
                    Prolog+Logic Server, allowing logic-bases to reason over
                    data accessible via ODBC. For example, a logic-base can
                    access a customer-order product database to configure
                    products, determine shipping methods, and compute prices.</p>
               
               <p>ODBC support is provided at multiple
                    levels. At the highest level, records appear as Prolog facts
                    in the logic-base. At the lower levels, Prolog rules can
                    issue any SQL command via ODBC. Amzi! Prolog+Logic Server
                    provides a Prolog development system with a Windows IDE, and
                    royalty-free static and dynamic Logic Server libraries.</p>
               
               <p>Amzi! Prolog+Logic Server 3.3 is
                    available in Professional and Personal Editions from $298 to
                    $598 and runs under Windows 3.x, Windows 95, Windows NT,
                    DOS, 32-bit DOS, and Linux. Amzi! also offers Subscription
                    Plus, which provides automatic updates for a full year, and
                    tutorials on Prolog and rule-based systems.</p>
