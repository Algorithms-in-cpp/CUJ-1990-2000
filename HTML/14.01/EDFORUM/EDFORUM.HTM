               <P> I'm writing this editorial in the
                    predawn hours before a C++ Standards meeting begins in
                    Tokyo. It is my fourth visit to this pleasant city in the
                    past two years. Yesterday, Tom Plum, my wife Tana, and I
                    joined the holiday throngs at the Senso-ji temple in
                    Asakusa. We shopped for pearls in Ginza, and just plain
                    enjoyed walking in the fine weather. Two days earlier, we
                    were watching sunsets across the Pacific from Tom's lanai on
                    the Big Island of Hawaii. For all that I complain about the
                    cost of travel &#151; in time, money, and energy &#151; it is rich
                    with such pleasant moments.</P>
               
               <P> One of the perks of my chosen
                    profession is that I have at least some say in where and
                    when I make these trips. In the past year alone, I have been
                    to Tokyo (twice), Austin, Copenhagen, Monterey, Kona,
                    Annapolis, and Nashua. The year before was similar, and next
                    looks to be even busier. Upwards of half these trips also
                    involve some sort of family vacation.</P>
               
               <P> The computing profession supports a
                    small army of people like me &#151; yuppie nomads who travel
                    from meeting to meeting, conference to conference. We pay
                    our way by developing standards, giving talks, keeping the
                    sprawling branches of a corporation in closer communication.
                    If the expense account doesn't pay for all those flights and
                    hotel rooms, then the extra earning power we've managed to
                    achieve does so. It's often a stressful existence, but not
                    enough to command much sympathy from those less fortunate.
                    Many people work just as hard, with nowhere near the
                    rewards.</P>
               
               <P> And that's the thought that inspired
                    this particular reflection. For all that the computer
                    industry still flourishes, more and more of us are becoming
                    victims of downsizing, consolidation, or simple cost
                    cutting. Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems harder than ever for
                    the bright up-and-coming to make that transition from
                    salaried commuter to jet-setting "experts." It's hard to
                    remain smug about my own good fortune when I see the
                    barriers rising for my younger friends, and the next
                    generation of my own family members.</P>
               
               <P> The pendulum swings both ways, though
                    the period may sometimes seem painfully long. I'm confident
                    that our industry is basically strong, and that it values
                    the contributions of individuals. How it compensates those
                    contributors is a matter for continuous negotiations, a
                    powerful force for restoring and maintaining balance.
                    Meanwhile, the sun is coming up, and I have another meeting 
                    to prepare for.</P>
