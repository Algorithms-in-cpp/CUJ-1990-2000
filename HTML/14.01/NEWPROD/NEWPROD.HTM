               <P>Vireo Software announced the release
                    of VtoolsD, a VxD toolkit for Windows 95. Hardware
                    developers can use VtoolsD to build optimized drivers for
                    high-speed devices, build Plug and Play-compatible drivers,
                    and prototype new drivers. Software developers can use it to
                    build debuggers, virus checkers, security applications, and
                    new file systems. They can also use VtoolsD to replace TSRs 
                    and build interfaces between Windows programs and legacy DOS
                    applications. </P>
               
               <P> VtoolsD for Windows 95's new features
                    include: support and documentation for new functions,
                    support for new dynamically-loaded and pageable device
                    drivers, and communication between Win32 applications and
                    device drivers. The new release also includes a revised
                    QuickVxD utility that automatically generates source code
                    for Windows 95 VxDs. In addition, examples demonstrate how 
                    to write Installable File System (IFS) driven,
                    Vendor-Supplied Drivers (VSD), Plug and Play drivers, and
                    Win32 interfaces. </P>
               
               <P> VtoolsD is fully compatible with
                    32-bit C/C++ compilers from Microsoft and Borland. </P>
               
               <P> VtoolsD for Windows 95 is available
                    directly from Vireo Software for $495.00. Current customers
                    may upgrade for $249.00. VtoolsD is also available from
                    select international resellers. Vireo Software provides free

               <P>Intel Corporation has announced VTune,
                    a tool that allows programmers to optimize Windows 95 and
                    Windows 3.1 application code for the Intel architecture. The
                    tool provides a visual display of all active software in the
                    system, including the operating system, device drivers, and
                    the running application being tuned. VTune identifies
                    sections of code using substantial CPU processing time, and
                    provides possible solutions to enhance the performance of a
                    software application. </P>
               
               <P> VTune is language-independent, has an
                    intuitive graphical display, works with industry standard
                    compilers and unlike most profilers, is not intrusive to a
                    programmer's code. VTune provides a scripting interface that
                    allows automated performance analysis, a system-wide view of
                    all active software and provides source browsing capability.
                    </P>
               
               <P> The system-wide view provided by
                    VTune gives information on the amount of time the CPU spends
                    in each active module and time spent between system and user
                    modes and for 32-bit, 16-bit and V86 applications. </P>
               
               <P> VTune provides warnings of
                    instruction sequences that result in penalty conditions,
                    instruction pairing, and number of clock ticks per
                    instruction. Also, developers programming in C can invoke
                    the C Tuning Coach that offers coding suggestions for
                    performance improvement. </P>

               <P>General Software has announced
                    Embedded BIOS Version 3.0, its third-generation BIOS
                    designed for embedded systems and consumer electronics based
                    on the x86 CPU architectures. Embedded BIOS 3.0 now includes
                    integrated support for the Flash File System and PCMCIA
                    Socket Services, in-place Flash BIOS updating, Advanced
                    Power Management, and comes with its own Mini-DOS and
                    COMMAND.COM that run from ROM for consumer applications that
                    don't need a full desktop DOS. </P>
               
               <P> With General Software's Mini-DOS
                    integrated into the BIOS, there is no need to purchase and
                    license a separate DOS operating system to launch DOS
                    applications. Mini-DOS uses only enough RAM for scratch
                    space and runs directly from ROM, saving valuable RAM space
                    for application code. Despite its small footprint, Mini-DOS
                    is a full-featured DOS that has all of the power of a 
                    desktop DOS. It supports CONFIG.SYS, AUTOEXEC.BAT,
                    COMMAND.COM, device drivers, and standard utilities. </P>
               
               <P> Embedded BIOS comes as a full source
                    adaptation kit, with over 250 source-level options and over
                    100 binary-level options that can be configured with its
                    Binary Configuration Program (BCP). In addition, Embedded
                    BIOS can be coupled with add-on CPU Personality Modules to
                    enable support for Intel, AMD, and other x86-based families

                    released CodeTEST, a suite of software verification tools
                    for in-circuit verification of software performance and
                    coverage, as well as in-circuit memory allocation. For more

                    probe that attaches to the microprocessor running the
                    program to be tested. A software instrumenter prepares the
                    user's program for in-circuit verification. The utility
                    reads program source files and inserts test point

                    ANSI C, and the emerging ANSI C++ standard. The probe
                    passively monitors the program as it executes and
                    communicates measurement results to the user's workstation
                    via an Ethernet connection. Run-time information may be

                    Encina 2.0, the newest version of its DCE-based transaction
                    processing monitor for three-tier, enterprise-wide
                    client/server environments. Version 2.0 provides users with
                    Encina++, for object-oriented development of Encina and DCE
                    applications. Version 2.0 also includes a new administration
                    tool for simple GUI-based system administration. </P>
               
               <P> Encina++ is a distributed object
                    development environment, supporting application development
                    and reuse of Encina code through C++ class libraries. With
                    Encina++, developers are shielded from the underlying
                    complexities of client/server computing. Customers can now
                    develop Encina applications in any of the three most popular
                    corporate development environments: COBOL, C, or C++.

               <P> For DCE users, Encina++ reduces the
                    programming effort required for underlying DCE
                    communications. For example, Encina++ automatically
                    establishes DCE security mechanisms and object location
                    services without additional code generation. Encina++
                    provides an interface to the Object Management Group's (OMG)
                    Object Transaction Service (OTS), the OMG standard for
                    business-critical transactions. </P>
               
               <P> Versions of Encina are available

                    for AIX product family. Encina 2.0 for the Sun Solaris
                    platform can be purchased directly from Transarc. Pricing
