<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0094_0059">HP Announces Standard Template Library Accepted by ANSI/ISO<A name="0094_0059"></FONT></h4></P>
Hewlett-Packard Company has announced that its Standard Template Library (STL) has been accepted by the ANSI/ISO Standards Committee as a part of the international standard for C++. HP has placed its implemenatation of STL in the public domain. STL, designed by HP laboratories' researchers Alexander Stepanov and Meng Lee, provides a set of programming guidelines and a collection of generic software components.<P>
STL contains a broad set of algorithms that perform the most common kind of data manipulations programmers use, including searching, sorting, merging, copying, and transforming. The algorithms work with data types residing in different data structures. For example, the <I>find</I> algorithm in STL works on lists, vectors, files, or data structures for which the concept of finding makes sense.<P>
STL also formally defines <I>iterator</I>, the standard data-accessing concept. STL defines several categories of iterators, each providing a different way of accessing data. A forward iterator guides the algorithm through the data from beginning to end. A bi-directional iterator lets the algorithm move forward and backward. A random-access iterator can jump around. All the algorithms are written in terms of these abstract categories. Because of this, one implementation of an algorithm works with any type of data structure.<P>
The implementation of STL may be obtained by anonymous ftp from butler.hpl.hp.com in the directory/stl. For more information contact <I>Hewlett-Packard Company, 3000 Hanover St., Palo Alto, CA 94304.</I><P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0094_005E">Cimulus Releases UPData<A name="0094_005E"></FONT></h4></P>
Cimulus Automation Systems, Inc. has released UPData, a user-profiling tool. UPData includes both a Microsoft Windows DLL and DOS C library. User profiling allows developers to observe how users interact with their products. UPData monitors a user's actions, such as which option they select, in what order, and how often. Information about which commands are most or least commonly used or in which operation or dialogs they spend most of their time can be collected and logged without interfering with the user or the product. Additionally, UPData can track internal warnings and error conditions, and lets users add their own suggestions to the log.<P>
UPData stores the information in a compressed data file, which can be returned by a user to the developer for analysis. Based on that data, developers can focus their efforts on the areas where they can provide the most benefit. For example, defaults and options can be set to streamline the interface and make it smoother and more intuitive to use; coded optimization can be made to frequently-used routines; and areas where documentation, training, or online hints would help most can be identified. When UPData is used to track internal code warnings and errors, a problem discovered by a user will automatically generate an accurate log of the condition that led up to the error.<P>
UPData is priced at $79.95 and contains both the Windows and DOS versions. For more information contact <I>Cimulus Automation Systems, Inc., 2901 Hubbard Rd., Ann Arbor, MI 48105; (313) 769-4108.</I><P>
