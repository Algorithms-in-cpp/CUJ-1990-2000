               <p>Them as can't do, teach. So goes the
                    trusty truism, rendered with an aggressive disregard for
                    grammar to distance the speaker from any personal hint of
                    academic pretension. Indeed, in the hills of West Virginia
                    from whence I sprang, it was common wisdom that too much
                    education was bad for the brain. The locals could recite
                    every school teacher in the past two centuries who had
                    developed so much as a nervous tic. It was understood that a
                    few souls had to sacrifice an otherwise useful life to
                    provide the (limited) education needed by the more
                    productive members of society.</p>
               
               <p> It just doesn't work that way in our
                    profession, at least not when things go right. The backbone
                    of C/C++ Users Journal, like any good technical trade
                    magazine, is the small cadre of people who write columns
                    month after month. Yes, I am counted among that number &#151; an
                    old warhorse &#151; but I'm talking here about my younger,
                    livelier peers. I take credit for just a few of the good
                    things about CUJ, but one of them is helping to select and
                    nurture, over the years, our current crop of regular
                    contributors.</p>
               
               <p> When it comes to computer
                    programming, you have to know what you're doing before you
                    can guide others. The best advice comes from people who not
                    only have been there and done that, but who keep going there
                    and doing that on a regular basis. The best teachers are the
                    doers who can also explain what it is they do right. And who
                    know to keep rethinking what "right" is as technology
                    roars ahead at ever increasing speed.</p>
               
               <p> There is a drawback to having active
                    columnists. Doers are busy people, and busy people get
                    spread thin. Sometimes they miss deadlines. But I'd rather
                    have a good writer in these pages ten months out of the year
                    than a reliable hack month after month. I'll settle for even
                    less than that, rather than lose a good columnist
                    completely.</p>
               
               <p> I put my money where my mouth is.
                    Besides editing this magazine, I run a little software
                    company called Dinkumware, Ltd., along with my wife Tana. As
                    our business has grown over the past year or so, we've
                    turned to others more and more to help us get things done.
                    Bobby Schmidt is now on his third contract with Dinkumware.
                    We recently signed Chuck Allison to do a project for us. Dan
                    Saks developed a seminar on our Embedded C++ Library and
                    delivered it to a major customer, with our eager
                    cooperation. More recently, we took an even bigger step. We
                    hired Pete Becker as our first employee.</p>
               
               <p> It was natural to turn to these
                    people. They have proven, over the years, that they know
                    what they're talking about and that they deliver. My only
                    concern is a second-order conflict of interest. If I keep
                    them too busy, what do I say to Marc Briand when he tells me
                    their copy is late? [Hmmph. So that's why Bobby's not in
                    this issue. At least it's good to know we're keeping him off
                    the streets. &#151; mb]</p>
