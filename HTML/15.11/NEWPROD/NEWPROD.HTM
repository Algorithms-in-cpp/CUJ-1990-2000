               <p>Seapine Software, Inc. has begun
                    shipping TestTrack 1.5. Originally a bug tracking tool for
                    the Macintosh, TestTrack 1.5 adds versions for Windows 95
                    and Windows NT 4.0. TestTrack offers complete feature parity
                    and virtually identical user interfaces across platform
                    versions, so users can work on their platform of choice and
                    retain full database compatibility between Windows and
                    Macintosh systems.</p>
               
               <p> With cross-platform support,
                    developers no longer have to create a custom database to
                    share bug reports between Macintosh and Windows development
                    teams. TestTrack users can begin tracking bugs immediately
                    after running the simple installation program.</p>
               
               <p> An addition to TestTrack 1.5 is Solo
                    Bug, a standalone bug reporting program TestTrack users can
                    distribute freely to their customers and beta sites to
                    automate reporting bugs and requesting features.</p>
               
               <p> Suggested retail price for TestTrack
                    1.5 is $129, with quantity discounts starting at $89.</p>

               <p>Sanders-Indev has released XMan, an
                    automatic documentation tool. XMan parses multi-file C
                    projects, capturing the file and line number of every call
                    to any error handler (function or macro), as well as the
                    name and location of the called handler. It also extracts
                    the handler's error message, along with any comments (C or
                    C++) that would explain the error situation. From this data,
                    XMan produces a complete "Errors and warnings"
                    section for a technical manual or a user's guide.</p>
               
               <p> While parsing the .c and .h files,
                    XMan builds a comprehensive chart, graphically showing all
                    caller-called relationships (including macros) in the
                    project. Not only does it show the file and line of every
                    call, it also shows the file and line of each function and
                    macro definition.</p>
               
               <p> XMan runs under DOS 3.1 and later,
                    and costs $195.</p>

               <p>Inner Media has announced Active
                    Delivery (AD), a self-extracting, zip-file developer's
                    toolkit. With AD, both Windows developers and non-technical
                    content creators can package any desired data and/or
                    programs into self-extracting ZIP files (AD Packages), ready
                    for transmittal via Internet, intranet, email, or other
                    data-sharing architectures. These AD Packages are then
                    executed on the client's machine, and can (according to
                    internally stored instructions) run programs, extract and/or
                    decrypt files, register libraries, display readme files, and
                    perform other helpful actions. AD also supports full
                    customization of user messages for localization and
                    international requirements.</p>
