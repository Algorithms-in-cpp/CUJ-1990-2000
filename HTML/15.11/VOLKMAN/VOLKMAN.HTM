               <P>There's an easier way to find C/C++ resources on the Web than

          <BLOCKQUOTE>
               
               <p>Handling the many reader requests for
                    Internet sources is always a discovery process for me. For a
                    moment, compare the Internet with your average small-town
                    library. The library has all resources cataloged, numbered,
                    and sorted. Dewey decimal number 671.23 corresponds to Early
                    American History and you'll find all appropriate works on
                    the same shelf. You know you're in the right place because
                    the online card catalog is authoritative.</p>
               
               <p> Now imagine your public library
                    indexed like the WWW. No nice index by author, title, or
                    subject. Just odd-looking fragments like pages torn out of a
                    book: the results of a free-text search engine like
                    AltaVista or Infoseek or any others. Now picture the books
                    ordered by some system unrelated to contents, say by
                    publisher. Could you ever locate a book by Ernest Hemingway 
                    in such a system?</p>
               
               <p> Like it or not, that's the state of
                    the net. Its no wonder that people can't find simple things
                    they need, like a B+Tree library, some Winsock examples, or
                    the C++ FAQ. Of course, I've replied to each request by
                    email prior to publication. But if you've got a better link
                    or tool to offer than what I've come up with, then send on a
                    brief email to them. Read on; odds are you'll find something
                    you've been looking for or maybe gave up looking for. At
                    this time, no more reader requests will be accepted.</p>

               <p><i>Marcus J. Ranum's "Poor Man's
                    Btree Library" maintains a simple balanced btree index.
                    Nothing more is provided than routines to insert, set, find
                    (specific, next, and previous), and delete keys. Each key,
                    however, has a spare long value that can be used to contain
                    an offset to a data file. A library to handle fixed-length
                    records based on these pointers should be trivial.

               <p>Autoduck extracts specially
                    tagged comment blocks from programming source files and
                    generates rich text (RTF) files containing the contents of

                    keyword lists. Typically, Autoduck is integrated into the

               <p> Here's a warning from Bob Nelson
                    (bnelson@iname.com):</p>
               
               <p> "This book is precisely 50%
                    excellent. The rating would (and should) be 10 (best).
                    However, there are the unfortunate annotations from Herb
                    Schildt. These 'helpful notes' are brimming with errors,
                    half-truths, untruths, and sheer fantasy. McGraw-Hill should
                    provide a large black Magic Marker &copy; as a value-added
                    supplement to this book. The buyer can then use it to
                    obscure all of the text on the odd-numbered pages." o
