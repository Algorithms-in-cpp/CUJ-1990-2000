It's been two years in the making, and often I wondered if it would ever see the light of day, but now, I can finally announce &#151; it's here! In early October, Elm Version 2.4 was released to the archive sites and the <I>comp.sources.unix</I> queue for eventual posting. Of course, with the backlog in that group who knows when it will finally be posted. I'll give the Volume and Issue details in a future column.<P>
Elm 2.4 includes several new features and a massive internal reorganization of the code within Elm. The most visible new feature is a complete replacement of the alias subsystem. Aliases are now presented just like messages. In addition, the prior restriction on group aliases has been removed. It is no longer necessary to make the members of a group be prior aliases.<P>
The Internet is rapidly switching to multimedia mail, via the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) and 2.4 of Elm supports MIME via the <I>metamail</I> package from Bellcore. This allows messages to contain voice and graphical information, or even binary files.<P>
Elm is available via <I>uucp</I> or <I>ftp</I> from UUNET in the <I>/networking/mail/elm</I> directory as well as via <I>ftp</I> from <I>wuarchive.wustl.edu, archive.cs.ruu.nl, uk.ac.soton.ecs</I>, and <I>ftp.adelaide.edu.au</I>. Please use the archive site nearest you.<P>
Other new items in <I>comp.sources.unix</I> include <I>utree</I> from Peter Klingebiel <I>&lt;klin@iat.uni-paderborn.de&gt;</I> in Volume 26, Issues 64-71. <I>utree</I> is a screen-oriented utility for navigation through filesystems, and for doing some default and user-defined commands on directories and files.<P>
<I>Psgraph</I> takes input files in a format similar to the UNIX <I>graph</I> utility and produces output in PostScript. Submitted by Jeff Mogul <I>&lt;mogul@dec.com&gt;</I> for Volume 26, Issues 72-74. The output can either be an EPS includable document, or suitable for directly sending to the printer.<P>
Adapting normal programs to be network client/server savvy can take some work. However, replacing the input and output at the file level with sockets can be simplified by using a network wrapper program. Juergen Nickelsen <I>&lt;nickel@cs.tu-berlin.de&gt;</I> submitted his <I>socket</I> program for Volume 26, Issue 75. <I>socket</I> provides an interface to TCP sockets at the shell level. Client and server sockets can be used from shell scripts or interactively. <I>socket</I> can also run a program with <I>stdin, stdout,</I> and <I>stderr</I> connected to the network.<P>
<I>Netpipes</I>, a pipe-extender program, performs a similar function by connecting UNIX pipes across the network. <I>Netpipes</I> from Robert H. Forsman, Jr. <I>&lt;thoth@lightning.cis.ufl.edu&gt;</I> provides for connecting arbitrary programs over sockets, extending the | character across the network. One major problem with his programs, however, is the entire lack of provisions for security. Perhaps someone will enhance them to remove this glaring omission. <I>Netpipes</I> is Volume 26, Issue 76.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="02B8_013F">Is .<B><I>reviewed</I></B> too Reviewed?<A name="02B8_013F"></FONT></h4></P>
These has been much discussion on the difficulties in getting submissions accepted by <I>comp.sources.reviewed</I>. Many authors have complained about their process being too drawn out and too picky. Others have defended it. As with all USENET functions, it will evolve and change, and learn from its history. One change they have adopted is to post packages after some "go arounds" even if there are still some problems.<P>
A linear problem solver, <I>lp_solve</I>, was submitted for Volume 2, Issues 21-23 by Michel Berkelaar <I>&lt;michel@es.ele.tue.nl&gt;. lp_solve</I>, a very efficient (mixed integer) linear problem solver, is based on a sparse-matrix dual-simplex linear-program solver. Berkelaar has used the program to solve linear programming problems up to about 30,000 variables and 50,000 constraints (on a 22 MFLOPS HP9000/750). Others have reported round-off errors on large problems, but report it works well for small to medium problems.<P>
Another old standby to the USENET Community is <I>compress</I>. This workhorse is used to shrink everything to save space and network transmission time and is the de facto standard in the UNIX world. Peter Jannesen <I>&lt;peter@ncs.nl&gt;</I> has improved on compress with an update. <I>compress</I> version 4.2, <I>ncompress</I>, is an update to the standard version 4.1 distribution posted as Volume 2, Issues 24- 26. <I>compress</I> is a fast, simple LZW file compressor. <I>compress</I> does not have the highest compression rate, but it is one of the fastest programs to compress data. Version 4.2 has a special, fast-compression hash algorithm. It uses more memory to provide faster compression. The output of v4.2 is still fully compatible with all <I>compress</I> versions from 3.0 or higher.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="02B8_0140">Games are still popular in X<A name="02B8_0140"></FONT></h4></P>
The latest in the arcade games to be translated into X programs is <I>xmris</I> from Nathan Sidwell <I>&lt;nathan@inmos.co.uk&gt;</I> for <I>comp.sources.x</I>, Volume 18, Issues 22-30 with patch 1 in Volume 18, Issue 59. <I>xmris</I> is a version of the arcade game Mr. Do in which you control a gnome in a garden and gather cherries for points. In addition, there are monsters to kill and a prize to collect from the monsters.<P>
A simple solitaire game similar to Klondike was submitted by Jon Brinkmann <I>&lt;jvb7u@fermi.clas.Virginia.EDU&gt;</I> for Volume 18, Issues 68-71. The program includes the images for the cards.<P>
While <I>utree</I> (described previously) is for character based terminals, <I>xdtree</I> from Konstantinos Konstantinides <I>&lt;kk@hpkronos.hpl.hp.com&gt;</I> is for X displays. Posted in Volume 18, Issues 31-33, <I>xdtree</I> displays a graphical representation of the UNIX directory tree using colors to distinguish between files, directories and symbolic links. Based on <I>dtree</I> from Dave Borman this new version has a Motif-based user interface.<P>
A new release of Bruce Schuchardt's <I>&lt;bruce@SLC.COM&gt; xgrabsc</I> screen-capture utility was posted as Volume 18, Issues 52-56. Unlike <I>xwd</I>, <I>xgrabsc</I> allows for root-window rubber-banding to extract arbitrary sections of the display. It also supports run-length encoding to reduce the site of the output and various output formats including several PostScript options.<P>
Also updated was Mike Jipping's <I>&lt;jipping@cs.hope.edu&gt; xvtdl</I> v3.0. The XView To-Do List Manager supports multiple to do lists, each kept in priority order. Events which are not marked as completed, automatically propagate from one day to the next. In addition, it supports recurring events and logging of completed items. Various print formats for both plain and PostScript output are supported. <I>xvtdl</I> v3.0 was posted as Volume 18, Issues 62-67.<P>
Another useful tool for those with <I>ftp</I> access to the net is Mike Sullivan's <I>&lt;Mike.Sullivan@EBay.Sun.COM&gt; ftptool. ftptool</I> v4.3 is a XView-based tool to assist in accessing files from remote sites via <I>ftp</I>. It supports viewing as well as transfer of files, and point-and-shoot file transfer. As one who uses it, I can add my voice to the clamor that it's easier to use than trying to find the files in a <I>dir</I> listing.<P>
For those working in TeX, Armin Liebl <I>&lt;liebla@informatik. tu-muenchen.de&gt;</I> has contributed <I>bibview</I> for Volume 18, Issues 99-118. <I>bibview</I> allows for the display and updating of BiBTeX databases. It even allows for the moving of bibliographies from one database to another across windows.<P>
On the patch front, <I>olvwm</I> v3.0 was updated to patch 2 by Scott Oaks <I>&lt;sdo@soliado.East.Sun.COM&gt;</I> for Volume 18, Issues 48-51. The OpenLook Virtual Window Manager provides for multiple desktops on the display. Patch 2 solves some window-placement problems, especially when windows cross desktop boundaries. In addition, some menu problems were fixed and the window menu now displays the windows for the current display (when multiple displays are being used). Also, it provides better support for the virtual keyboard keys.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="02B8_0141">Communications in <B><I>misc</I><A name="02B8_0141"></B></FONT></h4></P>
Several of over 20MB of postings in <I>comp.sources.misc</I> relate to communications. Warren Tucker <I>&lt;wht@n4hgf.Mt-Park.GA.US&gt;</I> issued the next major update to his <I>ECU</I> utility. Version 3.20 was released as Volume 32, Issues 36-75. Patch 1 is Volume 32, Issue 76, patch 2 in Volume 32, Issue 82 and the documentation for <I>ECU</I> is Volume 32 Issues 77-81.<P>
<I>ECU</I> (Extended Call Utility) is a research and engineering communications program originally written for users of SCO UNIX V.3.2/386 and XENIX V on 80286 and 80386 systems. Support for other systems has been added and further porting is possible with "minor" effort to other systems based on or similar to UNIX System V. <I>ECU</I> supports arbitrary video consoles and X displays via the <I>Xterm</I> utility. It also supports numerous file-transfer protocols including: XMODEM, XMODEM/CRC, XMODEM-1K, YMODEM/CRC Batch, ZMODEM/CRC-16, ZMODEM/CRC-32, C-Kermit 5, and SEAlink.<P>
<I>procmail</I>, a program to support automated mail processing was updated to version 2.71 by Stephen R. van den Berg <I>&lt;berg@pool.informatik.rwth-aachen.de&gt;</I> for Volume 31, Issues 40-44. <I>procmail</I> can be used to create mail-servers, create mailing lists, sort your incoming mail into separate folders/files (real convenient when subscribing to one or more mailing lists or for prioritizing your mail), preprocess your mail, start any programs upon mail arrival (e.g. to generate different chimes on your workstation for different types of mail), or selectively forward certain incoming mail automatically to someone. It also includes the program <I>formail</I>, which enables you to generate autoreplies, split up digests/mailboxes into the original messages, do some very simple header-munching/extraction, or force mail into mail-format (with leading <I>From</I> line).<P>
A generic version of the ZIP compression and file-packing utilities is maintained by the Info-ZIP group <I>&lt;zip-bugs@cs.ucla.edu&gt;</I>. They have released <I>zip19</I>, version 1.9 of Zip for Volume 31. Issues 93-103 with patch 1 in Volume 31, issue 133. This version of Zip has been ported to a wide array of UNIX and other mainframes, minis, and micros. Although highly compatible with PKware's PKZIP and PKUNZIP utilities of MS-DOS fame, its primary objective has been one of portability and other-than-MS-DOS functionality. Features not found in the PKWare version include creation of Zip files in a pipe or on a device; VMS and OS/2 extended file attributes; conversion from UNIX to MS-DOS text-file format; the <I>ZipSplit</I> and <I>ZipNote</I> utilities; and, of course, the ability to run on most of your favorite operating systems.<P>
The companion <I>unzip50</I> was posted as Volume 31, Issues 104-117. Windows UnZip, <I>wizunzip</I>, Volume 31, Issues<B> </B>118-123, is an add-on set of source files to convert UnZip 5.0 into<B> </B>a native Windows 3.x program. It is compatible with both<B> </B>Windows 3.0 and 3.1. Lastly, the encryption utility <I>zcrypt19</I> was<B> </B>posted as Volume 31, Issue 128.<P>
Two different C++ approaches to command-line argument<B> </B>parsing were posted. <I>options</I> is a bare-bones package that<B> </B>does just the basics with very few bells and whistles thrown in.<B> </B>It was contributed by Brad Appleton<B> </B><I>&lt;brad@hcx1.ssd.csd.harris.com&gt;</I> for Volume 31, Issues 45<B> </B>and 46. The other package, <I>CmdLine</I>, also from Brad, and<B> </B>posted in Volume 31, Issues 47-54, is a fully object-oriented<B> </B>approach to command-line parsing that does more than most<B> </B>of you could ever want. <I>CmdLine</I> also comes with a program<B> </B>named <I>cmdparse</I> (similar to <I>parseargs</I>) to parse arguments<B> </B>for your shell-scripts (including <I>perl</I> and <I>tcl</I>).<P>
Rich Salz <I>&lt;rsalz@osf.org&gt;</I> has contributed <I>editline</I> for<B> </B>Volume 31, Issue 71. <I>editline</I> is a line-editing library. It can<B> </B>be linked into almost any program to provide command-line<B> </B>editing and recall. It is call-compatible with the Free Software<B> </B>Foundation's <I>readline</I> library, but it is a fraction of the size<B> </B>(and offers fewer features). It does not use standard I/O and is<B> </B>distributed under a "C News-like" copyright.<P>
Kent Landfield <I>&lt;kent@sparky.sterling.com&gt;</I>, the<B> </B>moderator, contributed an update to his own <I>lc</I> package for<B> </B>Volume 31, Issues 72 and 73 with patch 1 in Volume 31, Issue<B> </B>90. It is much like the <I>ls</I> command except that it separates the<B> </B>types of files into groups and then displays located filenames<B> </B>to the user in a columnar fashion. <I>lc</I> has incorporated minimal<B> </B>spell-checking for people whose fingers like to transpose<B> </B>characters regularly. It uses three different environment variables<B> </B><I>COLS, CDPATH</I>, and <I>LC</I>, allowing you to customize how you wish<B> </B><I>lc</I> to perform on a default basis.<P>
Lee Hounshell <I>&lt;tlhouns@srv.pacbell.com&gt;</I> contributed<B> </B><I>var</I>, his C++ object library. It could be called a "super-string"<B> </B>class. The <I>var</I> class does a pretty good job of offering a data<B> </B>object that assumes its "type" at runtime, based on context of<B> </B>use. Rarely will you need to declare <I>ints, longs, doubles</I>, or<B> </B><I>char[]</I> or even string objects again! <I>var</I> does it all (or at least<B> </B>tries to). <I>var</I> is Volume 31, Issues 91 and 92.<P>
While <I>tags</I> works well for C files, it does not understand<B> </B>C++ syntax. So Sam Kendall <I>&lt;kendall@centerline.com&gt;</I> has<B> </B>contributed <I>tags</I>++ for Volume 31, Issues 124-126. <I>tags</I>++ is<B> </B>an enhanced version of <I>etags</I> and <I>tags.el</I> (for use with GNU<B> </B>Emacs Version 18) and <I>ctags</I> (for use with <I>vi</I>). The<B> </B>enhancements support C++, and they support C better than the<B> </B>standard <I>etags, tags.el</I>, and <I>ctags.</I><P>
An official release of Conor P. Cahill's <I>&lt;cpcahil@vti.com&gt;</I><I><B> </I></B><I>dbmalloc</I> was posted as Volume 32, Issues 5-15. This library<B> </B>contains a drop-in replacement for the standard dynamic<B> </B>memory allocation routines and many of the other C modules<B> </B>that are typically used to access and/or manipulate these data<B> </B>areas. The replacements function almost identically to the<B> </B>original functions with the exception that they perform a significant amount of error checking and/or validating. This<B> </B>version contains the many changes since the <I>comp.sources.reviewed</I><B> </B>release at patch level 7, in Volume 2, Issue 1.<P>
On the patch front, <I>jgraph</I> has patch 8.1 issued by James<B> </B>Plank <I>&lt;jsp@Princeton.EDU&gt;</I> for Volume 31, Issue 56. This<B> </B>patch fixes some bugs with labels and line lengths on legends.<B> </B>Patch 8.2 was in Volume 32, Issue 90 and changes the<B> </B>bounding box to integers for better compatability and added the<B> </B>ability to specify the file name on the command line.<P>
Patch 6 was issued for <I>pdksh</I> by Simon J. Gerraty<B> </B><I>&lt;sjg@zen.void.oz.au&gt;</I> for Volume 31, Issues 74 and 75. The<B> </B>patch fixes a bug in redirected loops, adds support for <I>FCEDIT</I><B> </B>and <I>COLUMNS</I>. The patch also added support for the BSD/386<B> </B>operating system.<P>
The threaded newsreader, <I>tin</I> received patch 5 in Volume 31,<B> </B>Issues 80-86 from Iain Lea <I>&lt;iain%anl433.uucp@Germany.EU.net&gt;.</I><B> </B>Patch 5 fixes many bugs and adds support for many more<B> </B>system types. It also adds an option to use <I>ispell.</I><P>

The latest and greatest version of <I>umoria</I> came in to<B> </B><I>comp.sources.games</I> from David Grabiner<B> </B><I>&lt;grabiner@math.harvard.edu&gt;</I> and overflowed our disks.<B> </B><I>umoria4</I>, Volume 14, Issues 33-71, tips the scales at about<B> </B>2.25MB. Now, although this is called <I>umoria4</I>, actually it's the<B> </B>source to version 5.5. <I>umoria</I> is a dungeon-exploration game.<B> </B>New features in version 5 include inventory commands,<B> </B>memory about monsters seen and their types, better support<B> </B>for low-speed connections, smaller and faster execution copies,<B> </B>and many more.<P>
For those with networks, the latest version of <I>xbattle</I> was<B> </B>also released by Steve Lehar <I>&lt;slehar@cns.bu.edu&gt;</I> and Greg<B> </B>Lesher <I>&lt;lesher@cns.bu.edu&gt;</I> for Volume 14, Issues 72-78.<B> </B><I>xbattle</I> is a multiplayer concurrent battle-strategy game in X<B> </B>Windows. Each player gets a gameboard consisting of a grid of<B> </B>squares, some of which contain smaller colored squares<B> </B>representing troops. Players command their troops simultaneously<B> </B>using mouse clicks, to occupy territory and eliminate enemy<B> </B>forces.<P>
A more cerebral battle is also available over the network<B> </B>via <I>okbridge2</I> updated by Matthew Clegg<B> </B><I>&lt;mclegg@cs.UCSD.EDU&gt;</I> for Volume 14, Issues 79-92. The<B> </B><I>okbridge</I> program is an interactive computer-mediated bridge<B> </B>game. It allows four players at (not necessarily) different<B> </B>locations on the network to participate in a game of rubber or<B> </B>Chicago (duplicate) bridge. The program handles the dealing,<B> </B>scoring, and communication of bids and plays. It is screen<B> </B>oriented, although the screen display is rather simplistic.<P>
The official release of <I>xpilot</I> from Bjoern Stabell<B> </B><I>&lt;bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no&gt;</I> occurred in Volume 14, Issues<B> </B>3-26. I covered this in the previews section of October's column.<B> </B><I>XPilot</I> is a multiplayer game which has some common<B> </B>features with games like <I>Thrust</I> and <I>Gravity Force</I>, i.e. you have<B> </B>control over a "fighter" (a triangle-shaped ship) which you<B> </B>maneuver through cave-like (customizable) worlds. These<B> </B>worlds have gravity (downwards) and scattered gravitational<B> </B>sources (miscellaneous types). Also, players may form teams or<B> </B>just have a plain old dogfight.<P>
