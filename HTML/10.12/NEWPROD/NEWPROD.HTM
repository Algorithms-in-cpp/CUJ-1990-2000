<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="02C2_0147">MetaWare Provides OEM Compiler Technology to CenterLine Software<A name="02C2_0147"></FONT></h4></P>
MetaWare Incorporated has announced a strategic agreement with Centerline Software, Inc., to provide MetaWare's SPARC compiler to Centerline. The agreement follows SunSoft's decision to unbundle its C compiler and development tools from Solaris 2.0. MetaWare's C compiler will be marketed as CenterLine-C and bundled in CenterLine's C integrated development environment, CodeCenter, for Solaris 1.0 and 2.0. CodeCenter (formerly Saber-C) was first shipped in 1988 and has over 8,000 licenses installed worldwide. MetaWare High C SPARC compiler is part of a family of ANSI-conformant, portable compilers supplied by MetaWare for platforms including Intel 386/486/P5, SPARC, MC 680x0, i860, MIPS, AMD 29000, and IBM's AIX on 370, ESA, and PS/2. MetaWare supports several operating systems including SunOS, AIX, and UNIX SVR3 and SVR4.<P>
The MetaWare compiler and Common Back End has been successful at compiling machine-generated C code from various C++ front ends and preprocessors and from Fortran and Ada front ends or preprocessors. Both NCR and IBM use MetaWare's C compiler to build UNIX.<P>
For information, contact <I>MetaWare Incorporated, 2161 Delaware Ave., Santa Cruz, CA 95060-5706, (408) 429-6382; FAX:(408) 429-9273.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="02C2_0148">AYECO Introducees COMPEDITOR-II Finite State Program Compiler<A name="02C2_0148"></FONT></h4></P>
AYECO Inc. has announced COMPEDITOR-II, a CASE compiler for generating event driven finite state, finite automaton, and decision table programs. COMPEDITOR handles state tables with up to 11,000 cells, and generates an ASCII file of C (or Pascal) code for PC-compatibles.<P>
Using COMPEDITOR to generate a finite state program (FSP), a programmer enters possible states and events in a spreadsheet-like table. States are the column headers, while events are the row headers. Then for each cell, the programmer specifies the next state to enter, and the name of an external procedure or a local block of code to execute. States and events can be added or deleted during development. COMPEDITOR can form up to sixteen FSPs within a single state table, and can form FSPs as metaclass, subclass, or standalone objects. Empty cells can be changed to error traps with Auto-Fill. COMPEDITOR can print the state tables (as documentation) in a variety of formats.<P>
COMPEDITOR-II is priced at $300 for the C or Pascal version. Contact <I>AYECO Inc., 5025 Nassau Circle, Orlando, FL 32808, (407) 295-0930.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="02C2_0149">Dr. Taylor's Software Announces Test and Big Test<A name="02C2_0149"></FONT></h4></P>
Dr. Taylor's Software Inc. has introduced Dr. Taylor's Test and Dr. Taylor's Big Test. Dr. Taylor's Test is a software tester for MS-DOS software which combines a memory-resident keystroke and text screen recorder with an automated screen-comparison tool. Dr. Taylor's Big Test uses a personal computer as an ASCII terminal to test UNIX, VMS, minicomputer and mainframe software.<P>
Test scripts can be repeated unattended. Comparison screens and reports document changes between playback runs. The test scripts can be used to reproduce errors for debugging. Scripts do not record mouse events or graphics screens.<P>
The test programs have two operating modules, a TSR utility for recording and playback, and a control program. The TSRs require about 13K RAM. The TSR records keystrokes and captures screens when triggered by a "hot-key" sequence entered by the user. Test scripts can be executed interactively, at a fixed speed, or as fast as the machine allows. The control program manages the TSR, and provides editing of the scripts, comparison of screens, and creation of screen "masks."<P>
Dr. Taylor's Test is priced at $199, while Dr. Taylor's Big Test is priced at $499. An earlier version was marketed as Ghost. Contact <I>Vermont Creative Software,  Pinnacle Meadows, Richford, VT 05476, (800) 242-1114; FAX: (800) 242-6116.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="02C2_014A">Virtual Technologies Introduces SENTINEL Debugging Environment for UNIX<A name="02C2_014A"></FONT></h4></P>
Virtual Technologies Incorporated announced their SENTINEL debugging  environment. SENTINEL debugging environment and library supports runtime verification of pointer usage and dynamic memory allocation in both C and C++. The SENTINEL debugging environment traps memory errors, traces stack and reports the source file, function name, and line number of the erroneous program codes. SENTINEL provides similar information on memory allocation, and if applicable, where memory was freed or overwritten.<P>
Debugging can be disabled at  compile or runtime. When disabled at compile time, debugging code will not be present at runtime. Debugging code can be enabled at compile-time, but disabled at runtime until a command-line argument or environment variable is used to enable debugging. Virtual Technologies suggest runtime disabling as ideal for beta testing &#151; beta testers can enable debugging when an error is encountered and provide more extensive bug reports.<P>
Sentinel is supported on Sun, HP, and Intel systems. SENTINEL is priced at $195 (Intel), $395 (Sun), or $495 (HP), with source and site licensing and volume discounts available. Contact <I>Virtual Technologies  Incorporated, 46030 Manekin Plaza, Suite 160, Sterling, VA 22170, (703) 430-9247; FAX: (703) 450-4560.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="02C2_014B">Pocket Soft Releases VMData, Virtual Memory for C and C++<A name="02C2_014B"></FONT></h4></P>
Pocket Soft has released a suite of memory-management libraries, named VMData. VMData provides a uniform, cross-platform method of managing dynamically-allocated memory in C or C++ for PC-compatibles. VMData (virtual-memory data) provides a virtual memory scheme that eliminates the restrictions of MS-DOS and provides portability between Windows and OS/2.<P>
A programmer calls VMData  functions instead of usual operating system interface and links to the appropriate VMData library. VMData distinguishes between  different types of memory and manages program data between them according to the priority of the data. VMData monitors  recency and frequency of use to establish priorities, or the developer can specify priorities. VMData accesses a variety of memory resources (including EMS, XMS, UMB, HMA, etc.) and when memory is  exhausted, VMData swaps to and from disk.<P>
VMData is priced at $495 for the initial platform and $295 for subsequent platforms. Contact <I>Pocket Soft, Inc., P.O. Box 821049, Houston, TX 77282, (713) 460-5600; FAX: (713) 460-2651.</I><P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="02C2_014C">New Class Library Supplements Borland Turbo Vision<A name="02C2_014C"></FONT></h4></P>
Faison Computing, announced tvPAK, a C++ class library that extends Borland's Turbo Vision with over 25 C++ classes. The library supports: validated data entry fields, currency fields, picture fields with mask characters, line and box drawing, time and data fields, clock and calendar animated objects, and aligned text fields.<P>
The package includes over 2000 lines of documented example programs and a 200-page user manual. Most classes support a feature known as property inspection, which allows certain object attributes to be changed at runtime by users. For example, the date format can be modified (at runtime) to support American, or European, or Asian formats.<P>
A full demo is available from  CompuServe (76530, 1013) or the Faison Computing bulletin board (714-833-7765, N81). The tvPAK library and source are available separately, each for $49.95. Contact <I>Faison Computing, P.O. Box 17722, Irvine, CA 92713-7722, (714) 833-8410.</I><P>
