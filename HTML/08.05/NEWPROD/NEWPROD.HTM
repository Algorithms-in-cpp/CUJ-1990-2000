<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0123_00A6">Drivers Support Borland Graphics<A name="0123_00A6"></FONT></h4></P>
Fleming Software has released Graf/Drive Plus, a software product that allows Turbo C and Turbo Pascal graphics program to produce output on printers and plotters.<P>
Graf/Drive Plus provides device drivers for Borland's built-in graphics library instead of implementing a separate set of graphics commands. This approach ensures a high degree of compatibility with existing screen graphics programs. Graf/Drive Plus is not permanently memory resident.<P>
Turbo C and Turbo Pascal support a wide range of CRTs via Borland Graphics Interface (BGI) drivers. Graf/Drive Plus provides additional BGI-compatible drivers for Hewlett-Packard LaserJet, Epson FX80, and Epson LQ1500 printers, as well as HP747OA/7475A pen plotters.<P>
Graf/Drive Plus is $149 for a personal use license (without redistribution rights) and $299 for a developer's license, and will be licensed to developers without distribution royalties. It requires Turbo C v2.0 or Turbo Pascal v5.0/5.5 for PC compatibles. Contact Fleming Software, P.O. Box 528, Oakton, VA 22124 (703) 591-6451.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0123_00A7">ALAC Works On Mac And PC<A name="0123_00A7"></FONT></h4></P>
United Data Corporation has introduced ALAC for Windows, which, together with MacWorkStation, will allow a host program to control an Apple Macintosh or any PC/AT, PS/2 or AT-compatibles. There are no restrictions on the language used on the host. Programmers not familiar with the complexities and intricacies of Microsoft Windows and Macintosh can build applications for these environments in a language of their choosing. Programmers have full access to and control over dialog boxes, menus, windows, and other features of the graphical user interface.<P>

HCR Corporation and Associated Computer Experts (ACE) have jointly released SuperTest, a robust, comprehensive test suite for C compilers providing complete conformance with the new ANSI standard for C compilers. HCR Coporation has also released HCR/C++ v2.2. HCR/C++ operates on most popular 386 and 486 UNIX systems. SuperTest uses more than 11,000 tests to verify conformance of a C compiler. SuperTest also checks for quality and in-depth stress, using more than 380,000 depth tests.<P>
HCR/C++ v2.2 provides extensions to the set of class libraries in HCR/C++ v2.1. The popular NIH (National Institute of Health) class libraries are included in source format, providing classes for strings, linked lists, date and time conversion, indexed arrays, hash tables, regular expressional and vector operations.<P>
The InterViews libraries developed at Stanford University provide a simplified interface to X_windows.<P>
Enhancements have been made to dbXtra; for example, hardware debug registers speed up execution by 300 times over v2.1 when tracing access to variables. HCR/C++ v2.2 also displays C and C++ source code, program output, display expressions and debug output at the same time through windows on both graphics and ASCII terminals.<P>
Version 2.0 customers can obtain v2.2 for $99.<P>
