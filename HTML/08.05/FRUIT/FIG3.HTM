<h4>Figure 3</h4>

<IMG src="fig3.gif">

<p><I>Figure 3 show a number wheel like those that appear in carnivals. The wheel is given a spin and the object is for people to guess where it is going to stop. A good linear congurent random number generators is like this. Knowing the last number created by the random number generator does not make it possilbe to guess what number well next appear. A bad random number generator does make it possible to make reasonable guesses. See figures 4 and 5 where it is shown that it may be easy to guess the next random number in the sequence.</I><P>
