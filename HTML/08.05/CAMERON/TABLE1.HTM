<pre>F1 will give you help.
F3 will re-issue the command without CR.
F4 will re-issue the command with CR.

All commands are either single, or double letter. Capital
letters in the table below indicate the number of significant
letters in the command. Commands may be separated by a semicolon

e.g. &gt;&gt;+s;r;e will increment the sector, read it in, then go to
edit mode. To assist searching for particular text issue the
command &gt;&gt;+s;r;d. Pressing F4 will interrupt the dump and
increment the sector.

The following commands are allowed:


Dump:                 Hex dump the buffer to the screen.
Edit:                 Edit the current sector. ESC to quit.
Read [T S H]:         Read in sectors worth of data.
Write [T S H]:        Write out sectors worth of data.
+/-Sector:            Increment/decrement sector
+/-Track:             Increment/decretment track
Sb/St/Ss/ N:          Set Block,Track or Sector.
Sh                    Sets current Head.
Vb/Vt/Vz/Ve/Vh/Vo N:  Vary configuration parameters
FS/SX [n1,n2..]:      Vary both sector translate and fmt skew

Log [Drive]:          Log in a drive.
Copy N:fn Blocks:     Copy Alien Blocks to DOS Disk in
                      Drive N:. Blocks can be entered as
                      b1,b3,b5,b8/b22 for example. b8/b22
                      represents contiguous blocks 8/22.
DC                    Disk copy - Make a copy of the Alien
                      Disk from Drive B to Drive A.
Quit:                 Quit - restoring PC DOS environment.
?:                    Re-display main menu.

EXAMPLES

&gt;&gt;C c:junk.dat 2/32   ; copies blocks 2 to 32 from alien disk
                      ; into file junk.dat on drive C:

&gt;&gt;R 32,2,0;E          ; reads data into buffer from track 32,
                      ; sector 2, side 0, and then enters edit mode
&gt;&gt;W                   ; ...after editing W will write back to disk
                      ; using the current Track,sector and side.
&gt;&gt;+T;R;D              ; Increment Track, read data into buffer and
                      ; then dump to screen.

As a final example, suppose you want, for some reason, to copy only
sector 1 from each track on side 0 to a file on say drive C, for analysis,
then the following commands will allow you to do it: (note they could all be on one line!)

&gt;&gt;Vb 1                ; set sectors per block to 1
&gt;&gt;Ve 1                ; set disk to 1 sector per track
&gt;&gt;Vh 1                ; set disk to single sided ie one head
&gt;&gt;Vo 0                ; set first block offset to track 0
&gt;&gt;C C:sects. 1 0/39   ; copy blocks 0 to 39 to file sects.1
                      ; on drive C:

&gt;&gt;Vz 1024             ; vary sector size, useful for looking
                      ; at strange disks which are for example
                      ; copy protected.</pre>
