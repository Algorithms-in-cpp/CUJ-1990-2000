<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0183_00D4">ASTA Announces QA C++<A name="0183_00D4"></FONT></h4></P>
ASTA, Inc. has announced QA C++. QA C++ is an automated software analysis system that analyses C++ source code and checks for 300 different types of problems, including deviation from the ISO C++ standard and company-specific programming standards, use of non-portable coding practices, and incompatibilities among different dialects of C++. QA C++ also produces a variety of reports which describe and rank potential problems, highlighting the function and line in which a problem was detected.<P>
Because it provides an automated mechanism for documenting and controlling the quality of source code, QA C++ can serve as the foundation for Software Process Maturity and ISO-9001 quality initiatives. In addition, QA C++ calculates and reports on 40 different metrics to measure and document the quality of the source code and its object-oriented design. These metrics include: Cyclomatic complexity (McCabe), static path count, depth of inheritance tree, number of missing method definitions, number of immediate parents/children, weighted methods per class, and coupling between objects. Through a process known as Demographic Quality Analysis, QA C++ lets users make comparisons of the quality of their source code from one release to the next, and to compare the relative quality of their code with samples from industry. Graphical reports such as calling trees and control structures are also provided.<P>
QA ++ can be configured to support the requirements of a particular company or department. Code checking functions can be added and turned on or off, warning messages can be modified, and reports can be customized. In addition to access through an X-Window interface, QA C++ offers a command-line interface which can be run as part of an automated build or "make" procedure, integrating QA C++ into a software validation, release, or quality assurance process.<P>
QA C++ supports UNIX platforms including IBM, SUN, and HP, as well as 386/486/Pentium PCs running SCO UNIX. License prices for QA C++ start at $6,000. For more information, contact <I>ASTA, Inc., 1 Chestnut Street, Suites 205/206, Nashua, NH, 03060; (603) 889-2230; FAX: (603) 881-3740.</I><P>
