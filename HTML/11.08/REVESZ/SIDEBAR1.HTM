Technically, the position of a point, relative to an arbitrary straight line, is computed with a vector cross-product. This concept should be familiar to those who have studied vector algebra. The formula is not intuitively easy to understand, but can be illustrated with the following example:<P>
<pre>(xs, ys) point on the line;
used as the vector starting point
(xe, ye) point on the line;
used as the vector end point
(xt, yt) test point</pre>
Rotate the vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise, the new vector end point (<I>xr, yr</I>) is given by:<P>
<pre>xr = xs - (ye - ys)
yr = ys + (xe - xs)</pre>
Project the test point onto the new vector, using the vector inner product (which many people are familiar with): <P>
<pre>dxt = xt - xs
dyt = yt - ys
dxv = xr - xs = ys - ye
dyv = yr - ys = xe - xs

D = dxt*dxv + dyt*dyv</pre>
If D is positive, the test point is on the positive side of the vector's starting point (<I>xs, ys</I>), which implies that it is also to the left of the original line (assuming that a right-handed coordinate system is used). <A href="fig6.htm">Figure 6</a>
illustrates the algorithm with the two test points (<I>x1, y1</I>) <I>and</I> (<I>x2, y2</I>).<P>
