<BLOCKQUOTE>
The common algebraic formula for defining two lines gives:<P>
<pre>y = k1*x + c1
y =  k2*x + c2</pre>
At their intersection point (if any), <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> of both lines are identical. Solving the two equations yields:<P>
<pre>x = (c2 - c1)/(k1 - k2)
y = k1*(c2 - c1)/(k1 - k2) + c1</pre>
The denominator (<I>k1 - k2</I>) is zero when the slope parameters <I>k1</I> and <I>k2</I> are equal. This singularity is expected, since parallel lines do not have an intersection point. Another singularity occurs when one of the lines is vertical &#151; it has an infinite slope. Such cases must be treated separately, which is a serious drawback with this algorithm.<P>
Another way to define two lines is in terms of two fixed points ( (<I>x1,y1) , (x2,y2</I>) or (<I>x3,y3) , (x4,y4</I>) in this case) and a parameter (<I>t1</I> or <I>t2</I>).<P>
<pre>x = (x2 - x1)*t1 + x1 -infinity &lt; t1 &lt; +infinity
y = (y2 - y1)*t1 + y1 -infinity &lt; t1 &lt; +infinity

x = (x4 - x3)*t2 + x3 -infinity &lt; t2 &lt; +infinity
y = (y4 - y3)*t2 + y3 -infinity &lt; t2 &lt; +infinity</pre>
At the intersection point, <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> of both lines are again identical:<P>
<pre>(x2 - x1)*t1 + x1 = (x4 - x3)*t2 + x3
(y2 - y1)*t1 + y1 = (y4 - y3)*t2 + y3</pre>
Solving these equations yields:<P>
<pre>t2 = [(y3 - y1)(x2 - x1) - (x3 - x1)(y2 - y1)]/[(x4 - x3)(y2 - y1) - (y4 - y3)(x2 - x1)]</pre>
The denominator becomes zero when (<I>x4 - x3) (y2 - y1</I>) equals (<I>y4 - y3) (x2 - x1</I>). Vertical and horizontal lines will create zero terms in the denominator, but the whole expression will evaluate to zero only when the lines are parallel.<P>
The intersection point can then be computed:<P>
<pre>x = (x4 - x3)*t2 + x3
y = (y4 - y3)*t2 + y3</pre>
