<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0287_00CF">Cobalt Blue Upgrades FOR_C<A name="0287_00CF"></FONT></h4></P>
Cobalt Blue, Inc. has upgraded their FORTRAN to C conversion software FOR_C. FOR_C Version 3.4 is available for MS-DOS, UNIX-386, SunSparc, HPUX (PA), IBM RS6000 (AIX), VAX-VMS, and Silicon Graphics (IRIS). In addition to FORTRAN-77, VAX, and MILSPEC FORTRAN, FOR_C Version 3.4 also supports PRIME and IBM-VS FORTRAN. FOR_C Version 3.4 offers static analysis and error-checking capability for performing code analysis. FOR_C Version 3.4 can detect common size and composition differences, unused names, implicitly typed names, loss of precision, and function call inconsistencies. Printf statements can also be inserted automatically for debugging.<P>
Other FOR_C Version 3.4 options offer compiler-like performance when a FORTRAN compiler is not yet available on your machine, e.g., when using an accelerator board or with signal processing. And FOR_C lets C code be embedded in the FORTRAN source. The FOR_C User Manual has been updated and rewritten to incorporate recent version changes. FOR_C Version 3.4 includes C source to runtime libraries, letting users move translated code to a variety of platforms, and two months of free technical support. The bundled cost for FOR_C starts at $1270 depending on platform.

WATCOM has announced WATCOM C/C++32 version 9.5, a multi-platform, 32-bit C/C++ package supporting DOS, Windows 3.x, OS/2 2.x, Windows NT, Win32s, and AutoCAD ADS/ADI. The C++ implementation follows the ANSI draft standard, providing support for the current AT&amp;T version 3.0 language plus exception handling. WATCOM's C compiler is ANSI standard and IBM SAA compatible, passing 100 percent of the Plum Hall compatibility test suite. Various Microsft C language extensions are included in both the C and C++ compilers.<P>
New features include templates and exceptions. WATCOM C++ provides diagnostic messages not only for incorrect programs, but also for correct but ambiguous or dangerous program constructs that might produce unexpected results. New superscalar optimization strategies improve performance for Intel 486 and Pentium processors. WATCOM's linker performs C++ optimizations that are possible only at link time, such as elimination of unreferenced virtual functions. Accompanying utilities translate object code to other industry standard formats and support interoperability with tools from other vendors. 32-bit DOS programming is supported with Rational, Phar Lap, or Ergo DOS extenders. Support for NewWare NLMs and GO PenPoint is planned.<P>
WATCOM C/C++32 is priced at $599, with upgrades from WATCOM C/386 v9.0 available for $199. WATCOM also announced a 16-bit compiler, WATCOM C/C++16. For more information <I>contact WATCOM, 415 Phillip St., Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, N2L 3X2, (519) 886-3700; FAX(519) 747-4971</I>.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0287_00D2">SET Laboratories Upgrades PC-Metric for C++<A name="0287_00D2"></FONT></h4></P>
SET Laboratories has upgraded PC-Metric for C++, their measurement and analysis package. PC-Metric for C++ Version 4.0 features include the addition of IEEE standard size counting measures, measures of control flow complexity, reports, and an interactive query and analysis system that lets users track metrics across releases. PC-Metric 4.0 for C++ also makes use of software complexity metrics to identify parts of a program's source code which are particularly complex and therefore more error prone. Developers can then use this information to allocate the bulk of their review and testing resources to those parts of the code which are most error prone.<P>
PC-Metric supports most programming languages, including C, C++, Ada, Assembly, COBOL, dBASE, FORTRAN, Jovial, Modula-2, Pascal, and PL/I in the MS-DOS market, all of which, according to SET Laboratories, will be upgraded with the Version 4.0 features during 1993. Compatible products for UNIX and VMS are UX-Metric and VX-Metric. PC-Metric Version 4.0 is priced at $399 for a single-user license. For more information contact Set <I>Laboratories, P. O.

Pure Software has announced PureLink, a standalone incremental linker for SPARC developers, as well as a version of Purify for Solaris 2.x. With PureLink, only the object modules that have been modified require relinking. PureLink diagnostics stress identifying the causes of build-time errors, particularly undefined and multiply defined symbols. PureLink will initially support C/C++ development on SPARC platforms.<P>
Pure Software also announced plans for an August release of Purify for Solaris 2.x. Purify, a tool for detecting and locating memory errors, is already available for Solaris 1.x and SunOS 4.x. Purify detects runtime errors in C and C++ UNIX applications, such as memory access errors and memory leaks. Purify adds checking instructions to an appliation's executable through its object code insertion (OCI) technology. OCI inserts checking probes into the application to monitor memory usage.<P>
Purify 2 sells for $4,000 per floating network license, and PureLink starts at $10,000 for a workgroup or 20 developers. For more information <I>contact Pure Software, Inc., 1309 S. Mary Ave., Sunnyvale, CA 94087, (408) 720-1600; FAX: (408) 720-9200; email: info@pure. com.</I><P>

UniNet International, Inc. has release two products, Splice and Z-BASE. Splice is a C software tool for programmers who want to develop or convert existing applications to run in a distributed processing mode on a network in either a UNIX or DOS environment. With Splice, users write distributed applications with C function calls as if everything were local. Splice functions mimic and mirror Standard C library functions, except that the effect of the function is processed on a remote host.<P>
The other product, Z-BASE, is a C library used to develop real-time Global Distributed Databases applications in dBase format over a TCP/IP network. A Z-BASE database can be accessed from any node in the network as if the database were local. Z-BASE is the result of "SPLIcing" a commercial software product, CodeBase. "SPLICing" CodeBase results in code identical to CodeBase except that file I/0 functions are replaced with SPLICE network functions.
