<p>If you open an XML document, you may think it's just another ASCII file with 8-bit characters. But, like HTML, XML is in fact specified as Unicode (16-bit)! The reason you can open an XML file just like an ASCII file is because of its encoding, or transformation format.</p>
<p>The Unicode Standard is a fixed-width, uniform encoding scheme for written characters and text. It is modeled on the ASCII character set, but uses 16-bit encoding to support full multilingual text (from English to Japanese and even Tibetan).</p>
<p>ISO/IEC 10646 is an International Standard that also defines a multilingual encoding scheme but uses a 31-bit format (called UCS-4) or a 16-bit format (called UCS-2). Since Unicode 1.1, these two standards have merged and are now equivalent. Currently, ISO 10646 has no characters that require more than 16 bits.</p>
<p>To enable use of Unicode in an 8-bit environment, a transformation format called UTF-8 has been developed. The UTF-8 transformation format maintains transparency for all the ASCII code values (0..127). For example, the character 'A' in Unicode (code 0x0041) is encoded in UTF-8 as 0x41 like in plain ASCII. The codes higher than 0x80 are used to transform the other Unicode characters. This transformation produces up to three bytes for non-ASCII characters. The UTF-8 transformation provides all the power of Unicode with the advantage of compatibility with eight-bit ASCII.</p>
<p>There are other transformation formats, and an XML parser can recognize several of them. The encoding used for an XML document is indicated in the XML header, as in <B>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?&gt;</B>.</p>
