<p>The following are a few general-purpose classes used in my implementation:</p>

<UL><LI><B>Dump</B>. This class forms a wrapper around <B>malloc</B>. It provides for automatic freeing of allocated memory in the destructor and a few common methods such as <B>create</B> and <B>destroy</B>. All these methods are safe. It is not necessary to worry about memory allocation and deallocation.</LI>
    <LI><B>LstList</B>. This class implements a double linked list. Member function <B>attach</B> adds an element and <B>detach</B> detaches it. <B>getFirst</B> returns a pointer to the first element; <B>getNext</B> returns a pointer to the element following the given element.</LI>
    <LI><B>LstLink0</B>. This is the base class for list elements.</LI>
    <LI><B>MemBuf</B>. This class provides dynamically growing storage for strings and byte arrays. It also provides the operators <B>&lt;&lt;</B> and <B>&gt;&gt;</B>. The most commonly used methods are <B>insert</B>, which inserts or adds a block; <B>squeeze</B>, which truncates a block; <B>getBuf</B>, which returns a pointer to the character string; and <B>getLength</B>, which returns the length of the data.</LI>
    <LI><B>DynArray</B>. This class defines an array of elements accessible using a character string as a key. Each element of this array is inherited from <B>DynArrayItem</B>, which is basically the key of the associated string. The main methods are <B>find</B> and <B>add</B>. This class accelerates access to objects that are accessed via a key string. o</LI>
