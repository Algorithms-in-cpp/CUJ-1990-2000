<p>If you are using only late binding clients, you never need to worry about networking issues. COM knows how to package and send VARIANT structures over the network, and since that is all late binding can ever send, there is no need for you to worry about the underlying RPC.</p>
<p>If you are using custom interfaces, however, the story is a bit different. Since you can use any C datatype or structure as an argument in early binding, COM needs a proxy DLL to take care of marshaling these arguments. The basic rule is:</p>
<p>A developer who writes a COM class that uses non-Automation types in its interface methods (a structure, abstract data structure like a linked list, etc.) will need to a ship a proxy DLL to your client.</p>
<p>You will then need to register this DLL as well as the server:</p>

<pre>
regvr32.dll comcalsps.dll
</pre>

<p>That said, there's nothing more you need to do. It's just a little bit of the plumbing jutting out of the drywall.</p>
