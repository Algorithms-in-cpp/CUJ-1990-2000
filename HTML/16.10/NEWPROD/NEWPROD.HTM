<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Black &amp; White Software Releases Object/LM 1.1</FONT></H4>

<p>Black &amp; White Software has announced the latest version of Object/LM, a product supporting usage control in a CORBA environment. Release 1.1 supports leading CORBA implementations, including Inprise Corporation's VisiBroker for Java and C++, and IONA Technologies' OrbixWeb and Orbix. Object/LM controls object usage and access based upon customer-defined usage policies. Object/LM also provides metering capabilities, allowing owners of software assets to monitor usage activity and bill users accordingly.</p>
<p>Object/LM fully conforms to the OMG's CORBA licensing and metering specification. It supports Access Control to manage the authorized usage of objects (including enforcement of licensing policies on software components), and Usage Metering to measure the utilization of objects (typically for usage billing purposes such as pay-per-view). The standard CORBA IDL interface is implemented along with additional administration and metering interfaces. Object/LM utilizes the Internet standard IIOP communication protocol, and includes a plug-in security and authentication module to prevent tampering with the usage control mechanism.</p>
<p>Access Control determines who has access to information and services. Object/LM's graphical tools can be used to define and administer policies for a number of access control schemes. For example, an organization can grant usage of its services to specific members. Some less privileged users might only be allowed to use a service outside peak demand periods while others might have limitations on how long they can use the service. Access control can also be applied to the enforcement of software license agreements. Policies can be implemented to support any licensing scheme (floating, node-locked, time-limited, etc.)</p>
<p>Usage Metering measures the level of usage of information and services. Object/LM supports popular schemes such as ''gas metering'' and ''postage metering.'' For example, an Internet information broker can bill for the access of data based on the report type, or a telecommunications provider can measure the time and quality of service of phone calls. Metering control solutions also extend to problems such as toll roads, medical services, and pay-per-view TV. Object/LM supports metering through the use of grants. Users may obtain access to a service with constraints, such as time limit, a predetermined number of allowed units or invocations, or a fixed number of concurrent allowed invocations. Object/LM uses a system of abstract units to account for the cost of use. These units can later map into currency or other abstract measures.</p>
<p>Object/LM is a member of Black &amp; White's portfolio of products for CORBA-based development, diagnostics and deployment. Release 1.1 is available now for Windows and Unix platforms, Java and C++ languages, and VisiBroker and Orbix ORBs. Pricing is based on platform and deployment configuration.</p>
