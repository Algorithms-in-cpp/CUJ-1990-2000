               <p>Rainbow Technologies, Inc. has
                    announced the SentinelWizard GUI, which guides developers in
                    implementing and integrating advanced protection into their
                    SentinelSuperPro hardware key. Developers describe how they
                    want to sell their products; SentinelWizard then
                    automatically programs their SentinelSuperPro key and
                    generates pseudo code to complete the protection process. In
                     addition to the SentinelWizard, this release of the
                    SentinelSuperPro software includes a tutorial on software
                    protection; the SentinelSuperPro key; SentinelShell,
                    Rainbow's automatic protection software; full on-line
                    documentation; and SentinelSAFE, an add-on that allows for

                Dyad Releases M++ v6.0</FONT></H4>
               
               <p>Dyad Software has announced the
                    release of the C++ math library and array language software
                    package, M++ v6.0. This C++ math library works in
                    conjunction with many popular C++ compilers on PC and UNIX
                    platforms. A number of advanced modules extend the
                    functionality of M++ into specialized operations such as
                    optimization, statistical operations, and finite element
                    modeling. </p>
               
               <p> Version 6.0 features a comprehensive
                    exception-handling package with both error and warning
                    messages. Version 6.0 also introduces a new set of "safe"
                    functions that test data arrays prior to operations, such as
                    log or square root, to prevent computational failures due to
                    out-of-range values. The library is designed to allow
                    Windows programmers to easily create their own popup windows
                    based on the exceptions. Additional features added to M++
                    include root finders and interpolation/extrapolation
                    functions. </p>
               
               <p> M++ v6.0 is available for $495 for PC
                    operating systems and $795 for single-user systems. Source
                    code is available. System availability and multi-user
                    pricing is available upon request. Demo software is
                    available on the Dyad Software website. </p>

               <p>Rogue Wave Software, Inc. has
                    announced Threads.h++ 1.0, a C++ class library that
                    encapsulates multithreading mechanisms such as C++ objects,
                    and JWidgets 2.0, an enhanced version of its collection of
                    GUI controls for Java application developers. </p>
               
               <p> Threads.h++ 1.0 provides a
                    platform-independent programming model for writing
                    multithreaded applications. This hides the differences
                    between supported platforms and offers a common set of
                    portable, object-oriented mechanisms. When portability is
                    not a requirement, developers can optimize application
                    performance by using multithreading capabilities and
                    controls specific to a target platform. </p>

                    classes can be automatically generated from the diagrammatic
                    Statechart or Petri Net entry. The generated Java class can
                    be automatically ported to and from C++ without changing the
                     diagrammatic representation. Therefore, existing
                    BetterState designs made for C++ applications can now
                    generate Java code with little or no modification. </p>
               
               <p> BetterState PRO is priced between

               <p>RT Computer has announced PROZip, a
                    Windows-based tool for dealing with compression and
                    expansion of files. PROZip's internal PROFile Manager looks
                    and acts like the Windows File Manager/Explorer. PROZip's
                    color-coded interface allows users to instantly recognize
                    the status of any file or folder. PROZip's extensive user
                    preferences allow the interface to be customized. </p>
               
               <p> PROZip costs $39.95. Competitive
                    upgrades for $29.95 are available if you have been using any
                    other compression utility. Network/Site Licenses are also
                    available. </p>
