               <p> Several years ago, I got this
                    less-than-half baked idea. I made a list of all the files
                    associated with a project written in C or C++ &#151; object
                    files, test cases, test-case coverage statistics, version
                    history, documentation, make files, and so forth. Much of
                    this information has a structure that strongly reflects the
                    underlying structure of the source files themselves. It
                    seemed to me that the whole mass cries out for a
                    hierarchical organization that captures the very structure
                    of the program. </p>
               
               <p> I tried to get one of my last
                    employers to let me play with the idea. At the time, Hyper
                    Card on the Macintosh looked like the best tool for
                    supplying hierarchical structure to a mass of loosely
                    related documents. But for whatever reason, the time and
                    resources for that project never quite materialized. And
                    since I've been on my own I've been way too busy to pursue
                    the idea much farther. </p>
               
               <p> Good ideas have a way of inventing
                    themselves, however, if only a bit at a time. The engine of
                    choice these days is the ubiquitous Web browser, such as
                    Microsoft's Internet Explorer or Netscape's Navigator. Add
                    just a modicum of markup to a text file and you can link it
                    to related documents in all sorts of ways. Using tools found
                    around the home, or a typical software development shop at
                    least, you can cobble up all sorts of interesting data
                    structures. </p>
               
               <p> For example, my brother Dave recently
                    described a couple of tricks his development group now uses
                    regularly. One is to place hot links right in the source
                    code to relevant project documents. The other is to produce
                    a cross index of all names in a program, then publish it on
                    the company intranet as an HTML document. They use a
                    shareware tool, slightly reworked, to do the latter. The
                    result is a low-cost introduction of Web tools to a
                    conventional programming environment. </p>
               
               <p> These are natural extensions to
                    prevailing Web practices that already support program
                    development. I can't imagine writing documentation, for
                    example, in any form but HTML these days. And I avoid either
                    sending or receiving software, wherever possible, except
                    across the Internet. It won't be much longer before I
                    begrudge typing in a URL, if a machine-readable file has any
                    prayer of saving me the effort.  </p>
               
               <p> My hierarchically organized
                    program-development environment will probably never turn
                    into a commercial project. Not with all the other demands on
                    my time these days. But then again, it probably will never
                    have to. I expect to get it for free, over time. </p>
