<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00BD_0064">New SCO UNIX Supports 486/25<A name="00BD_0064"></FONT></h4></P>
The Santa Cruz Operation, Inc. has released SCO UNIX System V/386 v3.2 Operating System, a multiprocessing extension, SCO MPX and a graphical user interface, JSB MultiView DeskTop. SCO UNIX System V/386 v3.2 and Open Desktop will support the new IBM PS/2 486/25 Power Platform for the Model 70-A21. SCO has also demonstrated new SCO UNIX System technology that enables applications to run on the new Intel i860-based IBM PS/2 Wizard Adapter.<P>
Multi-user, multi-tasking SCO UNIX System V/386 v3.2 is an AT&amp;T-licensed implementation of UNIX System V/386 v3.2 for 386- and 486-based computers. It complies with POSIX and X/Open standards and is designed to meet the U.S. government's Department of Defense C2-level security requirements. It runs both XENIX and UNIX System-based applications, and will also run MS-DOS applications when combined with SCO VP/ix.<P>
Open Desktop is SCO's graphical operating system. Based on SCO UNIX System V, it includes a relational database, networking, X windows with OSF/Motif, and MS-DOS compatibility.<P>
SCO MPX is a multiprocessing extension to the SCO UNIX System V/386 v3.2 Operating System and to SCO's new Open Desktop.<P>
SCO MPX is based on multiprocessing software technology developed by Corollary, Inc. Through a joint development agreement between Corollary and SCO this technology was adapted to become the standard multiprocessing extension for SCO Operating Systems.<P>
In addition to OEM designs based on the Corollary 386/smp and 486/smp, SCO MPX supports the Apricot MC486, the Compaq Systempro, the Mitac Series 500, and the Zenith Z1000.<P>
SCO MPX will install on any supported computer running SCO UNIX System V/386 v3.2 or SCO's Open Desktop, and will support one additional CPU per package. In addition to the SCO UNIX System V/386 Operating System, as many as 15 SCO MPX packages can be utilized on a single machine, thereby supporting 16 total CPUs.<P>
Modifications are installed into the SCO UNIX System kernel to support symmetrical, closely coupled multiprocessing. Each CPU runs simultaneously from a single SCO UNIX System, processing the system and user tasks in priority order. This automatically balances the load across all CPUs. On supported hardware, there is nearly a linear increase in overall system CPU throughput with each added CPU, maximizing the total available computing resources of the system.<P>
JSB MultiView DeskTop is a graphical user interface for MS-DOS users who want to share data and files with SCO XENIX and SCO UNIX Systems on a network.<P>
JSB MultiView DeskTop enables users to connect any 286- or 386-based PC running Microsoft Windows to an SCO XENIX or SCO UNIX System-based host via a direct RS232 connection or a local area network. The JSB MultiView DeskTop enables users to choose from local MS-DOS applications or remote SCO XENIX or SCO UNIX System applications. When selected, these applications appear in concurrently running windows on the PC. Users can transfer files and "copy and paste" data among the discrete MS-DOS, XENIX, and/or UNIX System applications.<P>
When used in a "mixed" environment, JSB MultiView DeskTop lets users protect their investment in third-party MS-DOS software and training while taking advantage of all the features of the multi-user UNIX System, including electronic mail and shared programs such as databases.<P>
SCO MPX will be available through all SCO distribution channels in the first quarter of 1990, and will list for $895. JSB MultiView DeskTop is $149 for a one-user license, $495 for a five-user license, and $795 for a ten-user license.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00BD_007E">MIPS RISC Gets API Standard<A name="00BD_007E"></FONT></h4></P>
AT&amp;T and MIPS have signed an agreement to build a UNIX System V v4.0 Application Binary Interface for the MIPS RISC microprocessor.<P>
An Application Binary Interface (ABI) specification tells software vendors how to write applications that will run in binary form &#151; like today's PC applications &#151; on machines from any number of vendors that use the same microprocessor architecture.<P>
Under the agreement, the MIPS ABI will serve as the basis for trademarked UNIX System V software for the MIPS architecture.<P>
AT&amp;T will make the MIPS ABI specifications available to the industry. AT&amp;T also said that the ABI specifications for the MIPS architecture will be compatible with other AT&amp;T ABI specifications.<P>
For more information contact MIPS Computer Systems, Inc., 928 Arques  Ave., Sunnyvale, CA 94086 (408) 991-7736 or AT&amp;T, 60 Columbia Turnpike, Morristown, NJ 07960 (201) 829-7212.<P>
