<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="02CD_00ED">Intelligent Tools Releases Library<A name="02CD_00ED"></FONT></h4></P>
Intelligent Tools Company has released Intelligent Tools Library (ITL), a library that provides C functions for developing device drivers. The ITL library functions provide control over four areas of device interface: hardware interrupt management, control of DMA hardware, access to DPMI services, and access to VDS services.<P>
The ITL functions that control interrupt and DMA hardware can consolidate common sequences of operation into a single function call. Other functions of ITL provide control over hardware on several levels. Register-level control is provided to give applications flexibility over hardware configuration. Common code sequences are implemented in single high-level function calls. Installing an interrupt handler requires: saving the old interrupt vector, installing a vector, and enabling the interrupt mask. These operations can be carried out with a single function call from the ITL library. Also DMA transfers can be delegated to the library, allowing a DMA transfer to be setup with one function call.<P>
The ITL library is designed for PC-compatible computers operating in real and protected 16-bit modes. Library functions are written in hand-coded assembly; an alternate function call interface is provided for applications written in assembly For more information contact <I>Intelligent Tools Company, P.O.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="02CD_00EF">MicroQuill Announces SmartHeap 2.0<A name="02CD_00EF"></FONT></h4></P>
MicroQuill Software Publishing, Inc. has announced SmartHeap Version 2.0, an ANSI portable C/C++ memory management library. SmartHeap Version 2.0 provides replacements for ANSI C <I>malloc</I> and C++ <I>new</I> that are designed to allocate large amounts of memory, minimizing swapping and paging in virtual memory environments.<P>
SmartHeap Version 2.0 provides several alternative memory managers, including an allocator for fixed size blocks, a stack allocator, and an allocator for moveable blocks. Using SmartHeap Version 2.0, developers can create multiple heaps, letting them localize data structures and reduce swapping or paging. According to Thomas Marvin, MicroQuill's President, "SmartHeap is particularly well matched with C++ because C++ applications tend to frequently allocate and deallocate large numbers of small class objects." MicroQuill's release describes SmartHeap 2.0 performance as "up to 100 times faster than most commercial "malloc" implementations, especially with heap sizes of several megabytes or more." In addition, SmartHeap Version 2.0 detects and handles many memory errors, identifying the source file and line that causes errors such as leakage, memory overwrites, double-freeing, wild pointers, and invalid parameters. SmartHeap also detects errors and corruption of its own data structures at the API interfaces.<P>
SmartHeap 2.0 source code conforms with ANSI C specifications, and is designed to be portable. The source code can be optimized for specific architectures by specifying appropriate manifest constants at compile time. SmartHeap 2.0 has been compiled with a wide variety of C/C++ compilers on a range of platforms, including 16- and 32-bit Intel 80x86, Motorola 680x0, and various proprietary RISC architectures.<P>
SmartHeap is priced at $395 for binary or $1,495 with source. For more information c<I>ontact MicroQuill Software Publishing, Inc., 4900 25th Avenue N.E., #206, Seattle WA, 98105, (206) 525-8218; FAX: (206) 525-8309.</I><P>
