<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0052_001C">Microware Systems Corporation For Motorola Single Board Computers<A name="0052_001C"></FONT></h4></P>
Microware Systems Corp. has released an optimized version of the popular OS-9 Real-Time Operating System for the Motorola MVME167 single board computer.<P>
This version of OS-9 for Motorola microprocessor-based products allows designers to use the power of the 32-bit M68040 processor, while providing complete support for the on-board serial, SCSI, and Ethernet hardware.<P>
The OS-9/167 Development Pak includes a number of new OS-9 device drivers for the next generation I/O peripherals included on the MVME167 board family. These include SCSI drivers for the NCR 53C710 controller which support Common Command Set flexible and hard disk drives and tape units. Additional drivers are included to support the on-board real-time clock and new CD-2401 serial I/O controller.<P>
Full Ethernet support is provided by means of the OS-9 Internet Support Package (ISP) and device drivers for the Intel 82597 Ethernet Controller. Support for BSD socket-based interprocess communication is also provided.<P>
OS-9/MVME167 is available in two versions. The OS-9/167 Development Pak includes the OS-9/167 Real-Time Operating System module and device drivers as well as the full suite of development tools.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0052_001D">High Level Object Management For C++<A name="0052_001D"></FONT></h4></P>
Software Ingenuities, Inc. has released Style, a C++ class library designed to manage all associations and links between C++ objects. The programmer specifies all classes, and the associations between those classes, with a few simple declarations. A small, intuitive set of functions is all that is needed to build bi-directional links between C++ objects. Style manages the objects in a RAM resident database.<P>
Style provides traversal functions that selectively navigate through the database of objects and perform operations on those objects. The operations performed by traversal functions can be Style's pre-written functions or can be defined by the programmer. Traversal functions separate the task of locating objects from the task of performing operations on objects. Because the operation is separate from the structure of the application, a programmer can easily port traversal functions between applications.<P>
The suggested retail price of Style starts, at $250; it is available directly from Software Ingenuities or through authorized dealers. Style supports Borland and Zortech C++. A UNIX version is also available.<P>
