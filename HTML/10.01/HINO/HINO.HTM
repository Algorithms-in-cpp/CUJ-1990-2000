Dwayne Phillips (VA) has updated his programs. The update contains a complete set of source code including the code that appeared in his "Image Processing" articles in <I>CUJ</I>.<P>

Bert C. Hughes (MN) has released ver.2 of his programs and placed them in public domain. In this release, he has improved the documentation and rewritten code to accommodate the fact that some Standard C compilers do not support signed bit fields (Roberto Artigas, Jr has contributed on this matter).<P>

Lyle Frost (IN) has contributed a shareware version of <I>cbase</I> programs. <I>cbase</I> is a complete multiuser C database file management library, providing indexed and sequential access on multiple keys. It features a layered architecture and comprises four individual libraries:<P>
<I>chase</I> &#151; C database library for indexed and sequential access<P>
<I>lseq</I> &#151; doubly linked sequential file management library<P>
<I>btree</I> &#151; B+-tree file management library<P>
<I>blkio</I> &#151; block buffered input/output library<P>
<I>cbase</I> internally uses <I>lseq</I> for record storage and <I>btree</I> for inverted file index storage, which in turn use <I>blkio</I> for file access and buffering. <I>blkio</I> is analogous to <I>stdio</I> but based on a file model more appropriate for structured files such as used in database software. The lower level libraries can also be accessed directly for use independent of <I>cbase</I>. For example, the <I>btree</I> library can be used to manipulate B+-trees for purposes other than inverted files, and the <I>blkio</I> library to develop new structured file management libraries.<P>
<I>cbase</I> is written in strict adherence to ANSI C standard while it maintains K&amp;R C compatibility. All operating system dependent code is isolated to a small portion of the <I>blkio</I> library to make porting to new systems easy. Currently, UNIX and DOS systems are supported. For UNIX systems, the programs were tested under Interactive UNIX; for DOS systems, Turbo C (v2.0), Turbo C++, and Microsoft C v5.1 were used for compiling.<P>
The distribution disk includes documentation, complete source code for <I>cbase</I> (v.1.0.2), and a sample rolodeck card program. Due to the volume of the programs, files are archived in ZIP form. Thus, we restrict the distribution disk format to MS-DOS.<P>
Since CUG295 <I>blkio</I> library is a component of this package, we will retire the volume.<P>
