                Pure Software Ships Purify for Windows NT</FONT></FONT></H4>
               
               <p>Pure Software has released Purify for
                    Windows NT. Purify for Windows NT provides a way to
                    automatically pinpoint run-time errors and memory leaks
                    throughout C and C++ applications, including the ActiveX
                    controls, OLE components, third-party DLLs, and libraries
                    that are the building blocks of 32-bit Windows applications.
                    </p>
               
               <p> Based on Object Code Insertion (OCT),
                    a patented technology from Pure Software, Purify can locate
                    hard-to-find errors and memory leaks. Because OCT does not
                    require access to source code, Purify can locate errors
                    throughout the third-party components used to build many
                    Windows applications. Purify can check multiple applications
                    simultaneously, and supports multi-threaded and multiprocess
                    applications, as well as applications running on
                    multiprocessor machines. </p>
               
               <p> Prices for Purify for Windows NT
                    start at $498. A subscription including upgrades and
                    maintenance is $748. European, Japanese, and Asia Pacific
                    pricing is available by contacting Pure Software directly.

                Subtle Software Releases CGEN 3.0</FONT></FONT></H4>
               
               <p>Subtle Software, Inc. has released
                    Developer Edition v3.0 of Subtleware C++ Class Generator
                    (CGEN), a Windows tool that creates persistent C++ classes
                    from relational databases. CGEN eliminates the need to
                    hand-write mapping code that transfers object data between
                    application classes and databases. With a click of a button,
                    it generates and implements C++ methods that read and write 
                    application objects. The resulting class definitions and
                    implementations contain complete, error-free storage and
                    retrieval methods. </p>
               
               <p> Once a persistent C++ class has been
                    generated using CGEN, users can refine the class and build
                    applications in a manner similar to their normal development
                    process. The resulting C++ application is then able to read
                    and write data using the original database schema. CGEN
                    works with and extends the capabilities of database class
                    libraries by automating the implementation of read, write, 
                    and remove methods for user-defined types. Developers can
                    specify the use of DBTools.h++, MFC, Borland's ClassLib, or
                    the included Subtleware SQLExec database class library.
                    </p>
               
               <p> CGEN runs under Windows 3.x, NT, and
                    95. Introductory price is $399. </p>

               <p>Imagix has extended Imagix 4D to
                    support the C++ language. Imagix applies knowledge-based
                    exploration and information visualization technologies to
                    reduce the time spent studying existing code. A new data
                    collection system enables Imagix 4D to directly analyze C++
                    source code. Also, the addition of flow charts provides
                    information about the internal control flow of individual 
                    functions. </p>
               
               <p> Imagix 4D incorporates visualization
                    and knowledge technologies to help users collect, integrate,
                    and comprehend information that is related to their current
                    problem. To develop a comprehensive knowledge-base about the
                    key aspects of the software being explored, Imagix 4D
                    collects data from many different sources. These range from
                    portions of the software itself, such as the source code and
                    the makefiles, to static and dynamic analysis data files
                    generated by the compiler and tcov and gprof utilities. As
                    it is collected, the data is integrated in a proprietary
                    entity/relationship/attribute database. </p>
               
               <p> Price for Imagix 4D is $2,490 per

                Sheridan Software Releases sp_Assist 1.1</FONT></FONT></H4>
               
               <p>Sheridan Software Systems, Inc. has
                    released sp_Assist 1.1. sp_Assist 1.1 allows developers to
                    create, code, and manage SQL stored procedures and other SQL
                    objects such as tables and triggers. </p>
               
               <p> User definable code templates,
                    version control, and ODBC support have been added to
                    sp_Assist 1.1. User definable code templates allow
                    developers to generate code based on the table structure or
                    the stored procedures. Code template libraries are also
                    included for Visual Basic, C/C++, Delphi, and
                    Internet/Intranet (including HTML, CGI, and ISAPI). User
                    definable code templates also allow developers to modify
                    existing code templates for specific needs or create new
                    code templates. Version control is integrated so third-party
                    software is no longer needed. Moreover, it tracks changes to
                    source code at the object/procedure level and allows the
                    developer to revert back to any previous version or compare
                    differences between versions. Version control also supports
                    check-in/check-out and milestones, which permits reverting
                    back to any previous milestone. ODBC support allows
                    developers to use ODBC connectivity to SQL Servers using
                    their favorite ODBC driver. </p>
               
               <p> Although sp_Assist 1.1 lists for
                    $595, it is available for an introductory price of $299;
                    Version 1.0 owners can upgrade at no cost. </p>

                Amzi! Announces Java Class for Amzi! Logic Server</FONT></FONT></H4>
               
               <p>Amzi! has announced its Java Class for
                    the Amzi! Logic Server. The Java Class allows developers to
                    embed intelligent components and agents in Java
                    applications, clients, and servers. These components
                    diagnose problems, analyze web documents, recommend
                    configurations, provide advice, monitor activity, etc.
                    </p>
               
               <p> Logic-bases are written in Prolog, a
                    language that has built-in search and pattern matching
                    capabilities used to apply logical relationship rules. In
                    addition to the advisor-type applications mentioned above,
                    Prolog is ideally suited for text analysis and generation.
                    This means on the client side, Prolog can readily parse HTML
                    documents to extract items of interest. On the server side, 
                    Prolog can be used to generate HTML documents as well as to
                    generate proper syntax for mail, news, ftp, and other
                    internet protocols. </p>
               
               <p> The Logic Server Class is implemented
                    as 32-bit DLLs that run under Windows NT and 95 with the
                    Java Development Kit from Sun. The Class provides over 50
                    methods for querying and managing rules and facts in
                    logic-bases. It integrates seamlessly with Java's exception
                    mechanism. Full source code is included. </p>
               
               <p> The Java Class is available in
                    Professional and Personal Editions from $298 to $598.
                    </p>

               <p>MultiQuest has announced the release
                    of S-CASE 3.0 for Windows 95 and Windows NT. This new
                    version supports the Unified Modeling Language
                    specification, proposed by Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson, and
                    Jim Rumbaugh, that represents the unification of the Booch,
                    Objectory, and OMT methods. </p>
               
               <p> S-CASE 3.0 also introduces scripted
                    access to its metamodel. Users can now extract model

                On Time Announces RTTarget32 </FONT></FONT></H4>
               
               <p>On Time Marketing has announced
                    RTTarget-32, a cross-platform development system for 32-bit
                    embedded systems on the Intel 386 platform. RTTarget-32
                    allows 32-bit programs developed for Windows 95 or NT to run
                    without an operating system on an Intel 386, 486, or Pentium
                    Processor. Popular C/C++ compilers from Borland, Microsoft,
                    and Watcom are supported, and DOS, Windows, Windows 95, or 
                    Windows NT systems can be used as a host. </p>
               
               <p> RTTarget-32 provides compact boot
                    code (6Kb) to start the target system from floppy disk, hard
                    disk, EPROM disk, flash disk, or directly from ROM.
                    Subsequently, the application program either runs directly
                    from ROM or is loaded from disk. The application can also be
                    downloaded using a serial link during the development phase.
                    The compact boot code enables execution of full 32-bit 
                    applications in as little as 16K of memory. </p>
               
               <p> RTTarget-32's Locator processes the
                    PE-files created by all Win32 linkers. A configuration file
                    enables versatile mapping of the application program to the
                    target hardware. Code and data may be separated into ROM and
                    RAM regions, or copied from ROM to RAM at initialization
                    time. The 386's memory protection capabilities are fully
                    supported. </p>
               
               <p> RTTarget-32 provides a comprehensive
                    runtime library on the target, and emulates part of the
                    Win32 API, thereby supporting software originally developed
                    for DOS or Win32. It also supports the C/C++ runtime system
                    for memory management and I/O, and provides additional
                    functions for real-time processing. </p>
               
               <p> RTTarget-32 supports cross debugging
                    with Borland's 32-bit debugger TD32, and provides some
                    debugging functions normally seen only in in-circuit
                    emulators. </p>
               
               <p> An RTTarget-32 developer's license is
                    priced at $1,700; complete source code is available for
                    $1,000. There are no runtime royalties. </p>

                    Sun Microsystems' Java Developer's Kit (JDK). </p>
               
               <p>The Java Generic Library algorithms
                    can be used independently of its containers and can be
                    applied to native Java arrays of objects, native Java arrays
                    of primitives, all Java Generic Library containers, and
                    java.util.Vectors from the existing Java Developer's Kit.
                    This enables the Java Generic Library to remain small and
                    efficient, vital for distributing applets and applications 
                    on the web. </p>

                Blue Marble Geographics Delivers GeoTransformer </FONT></FONT></H4>
               
               <p>Blue Marble Geographics has launched
                    GeoTransformer. GeoTransformer is a DLL that empowers C++,
                    VB, Powerbuilder, and Delphi developers to efficiently
                    rectify and transform raster data, using three methods of
                    transformation: affine, first-order polynomial, and
                    second-order polynomial. </p>
               
               <p> GeoTransformer reads and writes the
                    ESRI TFW and WLD, MapInfo TAB, GeoTIFF, and the Blue Marble
                    RSF reference file formats. It also imports and exports
                    raster data in the TIFF, BMP, and JPG formats. Additional
                    import formats are PCX, NOAA NOS, and BSB Electronic Chart.
                    </p>
