               <p>This program acts as a file filter
                    that will convert a C or C++ source file into an HTML file,
                    providing two enhancing formatting capabilities. The
                    resulting HTML document displays regular code as bold, and
                    it displays comments in italics. </p>
               
               <p> The output of this filter can easily
                    be inserted into an HTML World Wide Web document and provide
                    a nicely annotated program listing. The utility properly
                    understands strings and character constants in the source,
                    as well as translating HTML-based special symbols (such as '&lt;',
                    '&gt;', and '&amp;') into their correct HTML characters.
                    </p>
               
               <p> To use the filter in either MS-DOS or
                    UNIX, type the following at the command line:</p>

<PRE>
C2HTML &lt; in file &gt; &lt;output file&gt;
</PRE>
               
               <p>The program reads standard input and
                    determines where the comments are, inserting in the output
                    the appropriate HTML commands as it goes. Note that the
                    filter is currently designed to automatically handle nested
                    comment pairs (not all compilers support this). </p>
               
               <p> The filter does not perform any
                    checks on the source file, so it assumes the file is a
                    syntactically correct program. </p>
               
               <p> Since the processing of comments is
                    very similar in the languages C/C++ and Pascal, I have
                    included two separate versions for each of these languages.
                    (The Pascal version is on the code disk and online sources.)
                    The source modules are called <A href="retzl1.htm">C2HTML.C</A>
                    and <A href="retzl2.htm">PAS2HTML.C.</a>
