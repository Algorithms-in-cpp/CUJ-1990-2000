               <p> Just a few days ago, I posted a
                    message to the ISO WG14 reflector. It was not an easy
                    message to write. Here it is in its entirety, as my Editor's
                    Forum for this month: </p>
               
               <p> I regret to inform WG14 that I find
                    it necessary to resign as Convener. My third three-year term
                    expires in mid 1997. I had intended to at least serve out
                    this commitment, but sheer exhaustion, and the press of
                    other matters in my life, now make that course too
                    difficult. Eight meetings a year (3*C, 3*C++, 2*SC22) is a
                    grueling schedule, and a real strain on the resources of an 
                    independent, both in time and money. I hope to be replaced
                    at the SC22 Plenary in late September of this year. </p>
               
               <p> John Benito has expressed a
                    willingness to take on the job of Convener. He is a person
                    eminently qualified for the post. I don't presume to hand
                    pick my successor -- I just wanted to be sure that at least
                    one able candidate was prepared (and foolish enough) to step
                    into the role. Rex Jaeschke will soon be sending out a call
                    for volunteers, so that X3J11 can vote on a recommended 
                    replacement in time for the Plenary. </p>
               
               <p> I've been involved in standards work
                    since 1980, in the standardization of C since the outset in
                    1983, in the standardization of C++ since 1992. The work
                    I've done within X3J11, and later within WG14, has certainly
                    been a defining aspect of my career. My current commercial
                    interests lie more with C++, but my aesthetics lie more
                    firmly in the C camp -- both in the areas of language design
                     and the standards development process. </p>
               
               <p> I may not be able to attend most
                    meetings, in the future, but I consider the ongoing work of
                    X3J11/WG14 important. Consequently, I intend to become an
                    observing member of X3J11 so that I can remain on the
                    reflector and continue to receive mailings. Be assured that
                    I will also continue my role as self-appointed historian and
                    sage, chiming in on discussions where I think I can make a 
                    difference. I also intend to continue to keep the larger
                    community informed of our standards activities through my
                    editorship of C/C++ Users Journal. No eulogies, please.
                    </p>
               
               <p> What makes it easy to step aside is
                    the people who participate so actively in X3J11/WG14. You're
                    doing a great job. What makes it hard, however, is also the
                    people. I will miss most the regular contact with friends I
                    have made over the years. I always look forward to WG14
                    meetings for this reason, with confidence that we will spend
                    yet another productive week in an agreeable atmosphere, and
                    have at least one more excellent Chinese meal in a
                    restaurant unearthed by John Kwan. The memories of Amsterdam
                    are particularly poignant, and will remain vivid to me for
                    many years to come. </p>
               
               <p> Thanks for everything, <BR>
                     Bill Plauger</p>

               <p>In "Programming with VESA BIOS
                    Extensions," by Chris Krehbiel (CUJ, August 1996, p.
                    37), the file vbe.c (Listing 1) has a bug in function
                    VbeSetMode(). The line in this function beginning with
                    _Window = ... is listed incorrectly. The correct line is</p>

<PRE>
_Window = 1024L*_ModeInfo.WinGranularity; /* convert to bytes */
