<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Objective Interface Unveils ORB<I>express</I> Real-Time for C++</FONT></H4>

<p>Objective Interface has released ORB<I>express</I> Real-Time for C++, a product that provides architectural enhancements for building distributed real-time and embedded systems. In addition to full IIOP support, ORB<I>express</I> also incorporates a Micro-ORB architecture that lets developers replace key components of the ORB itself.</p>
<p>The ORB<I>express</I> Resource Allocation Control Environment (RACE) also allows the developer to manage the impact of limited resources on service quality. The small memory footprint of ORB<I>express</I> Real-Time for C++ is useful for memory-constrained devices, like routers and switches. Another capability, Distributed Priority Inheritance, reduces the intersystem priority inversion problems often found in distributed real-time systems.</p>
