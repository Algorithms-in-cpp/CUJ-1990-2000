The CUG Library has assemblers, cross-assemblers, C compilers, and other tools for use with the 68000 family of CPUs. Each of these volumes is available for only $4 per diskette. Alternately, all of these titles are included on the CUG Library CD-ROM. Order using the form provided in the center leaf of this issue or send mail to <I>cujsub@rdpub.com</I> for more information.<P>

------------------------------------
CUG190   Steve Passe's 68K Assembler
CUG204   68000 C Compiler
CUG261   68K Cross Assembler, MSDOS
CUG303   MC68K Disassembler*
CUG338   68000 C Compiler and Assembler (2 disks)
CUG363   68020 Cross Assembler (2 disks)</pre>
* The CUG303 MC68K Disassembler is considerably less advanced than M68KDIS. For example, it does not include instruction-level support for 68010, 68020, 68851, or 68881/68882 chips. Also MC68K omits Macintosh support and the ability to declare regions of the file as data or code.<P>
