<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00FC_009F">Terasoft Announces OEW For C++ 2.0<A name="00FC_009F"></FONT></h4></P>
Innovative Software, GmbH, has announced The Object Engineering Workbench Version 2.0, (OEW for C++), for Microsoft Windows, Windows NT, and OS/2 Warp. OEW for C++ is a software development and maintenance workbench which can work with your choice of C++ Compiler IDE during coding and debugging.<P>
OEW provides parsing and reverse engineering capabilities for importing code, including incomplete projects or syntactically incorrect code. OEW can import programs or class libraries and provides a means to merge the imported code with a new or existing application and then regenerate the application. OEW can generate the database schema for ObjectStore from Object Design, Inc. or for POET from Poet Software, providing integration with OODBMSs.<P>
Innovative Software has released a "Small Project Edition" (SPE) of OEW &#151; a technically limited version of the full OEW for C++ product, supplied free of charge for evaluation purposes. The SPE provides the functionality of the full implementation, but cannot save sizable projects. The SPE is available on CD-ROM in both English and German versions, and is also available via CompuServe or the Internet.<P>
Terasoft Technology Corporation is the exclusive provider for OEW in North America. The list price of OEW's multi-platform version is $995. Plans call for release of UNIX versions later this year.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00FC_00A0">Symantec Announces Symantec C++ 7.0<A name="00FC_00A0"></FONT></h4></P>
Symantec Corporation has announced Symantec C++ 7.0, for 16-bit or 32-bit development, with an object-oriented browser/editor, and a network build tool (NetBuild). Symantec C++ 7.0 supports programmer productivity under Windows 3.1, Windows NT 3.5, and Windows '95, by combining a parser and object-oriented editor with tools for decreasing build time, and by exploiting network resources. Symantec C++ 7.0 provides 32-bit support for the beta release of Windows '95, through a pre-release CD available separately from Symantec.<P>
Symantec C++ 7.0 provides an incremental parser and an object-oriented browser/editor which supports three views: a graphical class tree, a three pane browser similar to Smalltalk environments, and a programmer's editor which provides Brief and Epsilog keystroke compatibility. Symantec BASIC can be used for scripts in all three views, for new commands or for customizing features. NetBuild allows users to distribute and build tasks across multiple computers on a network. Symantec C++ 7.0 includes OPTLINK 6.0, a linker which supports 16- and 32-bit applications, and eliminates the CVPACK step. OPTLINK 6.0 also provides EXE and DLL compression for WIndows 3.1 applications. Symantec C++ 7.0 also includes AppExpress, ClassExpress, and ProjectExpress. AppExpress includes options to generate OLE 2.0 servers and containers and applications using MDI or SDI type interfaces. ClassExpress allows developers to customize the behavior of Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) applications. ProjectExpress takes programmers through the IDE steps necessary to create a project. Symantec C++ 7.0 also includes ResourceStudio and the Multiscope debugger, as well as MFC versions 2.51 and 3.0, and support for ODBC and OLE 2.0.<P>
Symantec C++ 7.0 requires 20 Mb RAM and Windows NT 3.5 Workstation or Advanced Server, or Windows 95 beta build 324 or later for 32-bit development. For 16-bit development, users need 16Mb RAM and Windows 3.1 or later. The estimated retail price for Symantec C++ 7.0 is $199, with upgrades from version 6.x priced at $99.95.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="00FC_00A1">National Instruments Announces Instrument Driver DLL Library<A name="00FC_00A1"></FONT></h4></P>
National Instruments has announced a stand-alone library of instrument drivers that can be used for developing GPIB test systems by users of Visual C++, Visual Basic, or any Windows development environment. The Instrument Driver DLL Library is a collection of more than 75 instrument drivers, developed using National Instrument's LabWindows/CVI visual programming environment and converted to custom dynamic link libraries (DLLs), for controlling GPIB test instruments from Tektronix, Hewlett-Packard, Wavetek, Fluke, and other instrument suppliers. The driver library of more than 75 DLLs and the accompanying documentation are delivered on CD-ROM.<P>
An instrument driver is a high-level library of functions for controlling a particular instrument. Instead of using device control command strings over GPIB, developers can use functions such as <I>Initialize(), Configure(),</I> or <I>Measure(),</I> to control their instruments. The instrument driver acts as a high-level translator between the user and the instruments, automatically building the appropriate command string for the chosen operation, sending the command over the GPIB, receiving the results from the device, and parsing and scaling the returned data for the user. Each instrument driver DLL includes a Windows help file that documents its functions, along with the required header files for using the DLL within Visual C++ or Visual Basic programming environments under Windows.<P>
National Instruments plans called for making the Instrument Driver DLL available during Q2 1995 at a price of $495. National Instruments also plans to update the library three times yearly. For more information contact <I>National Instruments, 6504 Bridge Point Pkwy, Austin, TX 78730, 800-433-3488 or +1-512-794-0100; FAX: +1-512-794-8411; E-mail: info@natinst.com.</I><P>

Dart Communications has announced version 1.1 of PowerTCP, which adds support for TFTP and SNMP application development. These libraries allow developers to add TFTP client, TFTP server, SNMP management, and SNMP agent capabilities to Windows-based applications. The PowerTCP UDP Toolkit includes C++ class libraries, DLL, and VBXs for UDP, TFTP, and SNMP in both 16-bit and 32-bit forms. A sister product, the PowerTCP Standard Toolkit, provides the same access to TCP, TELNET, and FTP protocols. The libraries can be incorporated in Windows applications, making them "internet-aware." PowerTCP can be used to prototype under Visual Basic, deliver with 16-bit libraries, and upgrade to 32-bit later, without additional licensing.<P>
Dart Communications specializes in TCP/IP components that implement TCP/IP protocols and supports the libraries on commercial WINSOCK-compliant kernels. According to Michael Baldwin, president of Dart Communications, "Many of our customers are porting their NETBIOS or async application to this popular protocol suite. Our components simplify the process, and help them get to market quicker."<P>
The PowerTCP Standard Toolkit (TCP, TELNET, FTP) is shipping for $598. The PowerTCP UDP Toolkit (UDP, SNMP, TFTP) is also priced at $598.
