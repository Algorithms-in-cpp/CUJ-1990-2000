<p>Softwrap has released Softwrap, a wrapper for authors and distributors that prevents piracy and manages the digital distribution process. Softwrap prevents piracy by encrypting any 32-bit Windows compatible <B>.exe</B> application.

If a customer wants to use the application beyond the trial period, they must purchase it or discontinue its use. Additional security features include checking for system clock rollbacks, built-in hack detection, and the prevention of wrapping already wrapped files.</p>
<p>Softwrap manages the digital distribution process by offering a service that manages the e-commerce activities for authors/distributors. Softwrap employs a monthly, user credit-card verification process that keeps fraud to a minimum. Payment for the application is billed to the customer's credit card. Softwrap deducts service fees from the revenue and sends the balance to the author in the form of a monthly check. Revenue after fees depends on the retail cost of the application and number sold.</p>
<p>Softwrap may be downloaded for free from the company's website.</p>
