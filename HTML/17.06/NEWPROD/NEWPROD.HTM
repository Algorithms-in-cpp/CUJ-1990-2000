<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Preview Systems Launches BetaQuest</FONT></H4>

<p>Preview Systems has launched BetaQuest, a service that uses the Internet to directly connect software publishers and their beta testers. A publisher receives a unique URL and password that provides access to secure web-based reports and messaging applications. A small application called eBoomerang, configured to track menu selections, display new messages, and capture users responses, works in the background storing information until the tester establishes an Internet connection. Once a connection is made, information is relayed to a remote and secure database that only the publisher can access via the BetaQuest website.</p>
<p>Preview offers publishers training and support, with fees based on size and duration of the beta program. Prices start at $25,000 per beta test for a test of up to 500 users, 12 weeks in duration, and up to six builds during the test. Annual licensing programs are available based on projected beta testing needs.</p>
