<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0045_0024">ydb Symbolic Debugger For yacc Grammers And Parsers<A name="0045_0024"></FONT></h4></P>
Bloomsbury Software Group is now shipping the ydb symbolic debugger for yacc grammers and parsers. ydb is a grammer development tool offering interactive environments for grammar debugging and parser generation on UNIX systems. It is 100 percent backward compatible with yacc, the standard UNIX parser generator, and so can be used for debugging yacc grammars, or for creating parsers more flexible than those generated by yacc.<P>
ydb provides a set of tools for producing correct, conflict-free grammars at translate time. ydb also offers users complete debugging control of an operating parser at runtime, including the ability to trace parser actions and set breakpoints at particular rules or other points in the parse.<P>
ydb is available immediately for Sun 3, Sun 4, and DECstation computers, and is being ported to others, including Hewlett-Packard workstations. ydb offers X windows, sunView and ASCII terminal interfaces.<P>
Prices begin at $1,250 for a single CPU license. The company offers academic discounts, quantity discounts and site licenses. For more information, <I>contact Bloomsbury Software Group, P.O. Box 390018, Mountain View, CA 94039, (415) 964-3486</I>.<P>
<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0045_0025">Intermetrics Provides Debugging Environment For Motorola 68332<A name="0045_0025"></FONT></h4></P>
Intermetrics Microsystems Software has released RMXDB 5.0, a ROM monitor-based, C source-level cross debugger for Motorola's 68332 processor. RMXDB 5.0 integrates the source-level debugging features of XDB 5.0 (as source-level cross debugger) with a low-level target monitor program.<P>
RMXDB 5.0 is compatible with Motorola's 68332 development system. The ROM-based monitor portion of RMXDB is pre-configured to reside directly on the EEPROMs located on the 68332 EVS, and communicate target information to the RMXDB interface on the host computer.<P>
Features of RMXDB 5.0 include the ability to display source code, registers, and stack information, set software breakpoints, single step at the C or assembly level, monitor and modify data, define macros and aliases, record and playback debugging sessions simulate target I/O, and access pop-up windows for status information and online help.<P>
RMXDB is integrated with the Inter-Tools set of C cross compilers, cross assemblers, and programming utilities for writing ROMable, reentrant code for the 68332. RMXDB can be configured for almost any hardware environment with a serial port. Intermetrics provides an installation kit to help configure the ROM monitor for the user's board. This kit includes pre-written driver programs, and configuration examples for a variety of off-the-shelf single board computers and common USART boards.<P>
Prices for the RMXDB 5.0 begin at $2,500. For more information, <I>contact Intermetrics Microsystems Software, 733 Concord Ave., Cambridge, MA 02138-1002, (617) 661-0072; FAX (6I 7) 868-2843</I>.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0045_002A">Design Tool Now Generates C++<A name="0045_002A"></FONT></h4></P>
Caset Corporation has enhanced the Hierarchical Object-Oriented Design (HOOD) Toolset to generate C++ code, in addition to ADA, to implement object-oriented designs. The HOOD toolset is an interactive, workstation-based tool supporting multi-user design teams.<P>
The toolkit organizes design information in a design database facilitating iterative design refinement. The toolkit generates documentation and implementation code in ADA and now in C++. Design information can be transferred between the ADA and C++ toolset variants.<P>
The HOOD object management system captures design details for later representation as C++ code fragments or ADA modules, so developers can implement each HOOD object as an instance of its own C++ class. Standard system specification packages and their own interdependencies are recorded as environmental objects. Third party packages and re-usable code modules are represented as class objects.<P>
The HOOD C++ and ADA mappings are separately available options. Either implementation language may be initially specified, the other language may be purchased as an extension. SUN, DEC, HP, and additional UNIX/VMS workstations are currently supported.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0045_002B">SDE Introduces OOSD/C++<A name="0045_002B"></FONT></h4></P>
Interactive Development Environments has added Object-Oriented Structured Design (OOSD)/C++ to its Software through Pictures family of CASE products. OOSD/C++ includes a graphical design editor that automates the standard OOSD notation extended for C++.<P>
The product's features include C++-specific drawing rules, which minimize errors, and the C++ Reuse Library and Browser, which reinforce the reuse capabilities of object-oriented languages while still in the design phase.<P>
OOSD/C++ also includes data modeling editors, a central repository, document preparation, and version control. An automated training tool that provides drawing support for the OOSD notation extended for C++ is available as part of the recently introduced "Development Methods for Migrating from C to C++ using OOSD" course. OOSD/C++ will be available as part of an open solution, called the C++ Development Environment.<P>
OOSD/C++ includes a graphical editor, which automates OOSD for C++, two data modeling editors, a multi-user repository, the document preparation system, and version control. The basic OOSD notation has been extended to include classes, member functions, templates, global and local scoping, single and multiple inheritance, as well as public, private and protected relationships.<P>
The product allows users to browse class hierarchies in the C++ Reuse Library, which increases quality and productivity by reinforcing the reuse capablities of object-oriented languages while still in the design phase. In the future, the library will be pre-populated with extensible class libraries. Another key feature of OOSD/C++ is the C++ Guidance System, which minimizes errors by enforcing C++-specific syntax rules regarding the interaction between C++ components, such as assembly of classes, connections between objects, and exportation of objects.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0045_002E">SparcStation 1 Now Hosts C Executive O/S<A name="0045_002E"></FONT></h4></P>
JMI's C Executive operating system for the Sun Microsystems SPARC has been repackaged to be hosted on SPARCstation 1. The SPARC is a high-performance RISC processor. The SPARC-based workstation can be used to develop applications before downloading to a SPARC target board.<P>
C Executive is a real-time, multitasking operating system kernel used in embedded control applications. The new SPARC version of the kernel allows current C Executive customers using CISC microprocessors to move their applications to the SPARC. The original SPARC port of C Executive was accomplished using a SPARC cross compiler on the Sun 2 workstation. The new version was produced using native C compiler, assembler, and linker running on the SPARCstation 1 under SunOS.<P>
The new SPARC version also offers an optional file system, CE-DOSFILE, and a system debugger, CE-/VIEW. CE-DOSFILE replicates the DOS 8086 file structure on external media, allowing SPARC-based embedded systems to read and write DOS diskettes online.<P>
