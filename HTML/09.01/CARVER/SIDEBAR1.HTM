<BLOCKQUOTE>

The ANSI C compiler for the iRMX operating system provides many features for working with the 80x86 family of processors. The selector data type is used to designate tokens that basically correspond to the addresses of object descriptors. The selector type could be replaced with the <I>unsigned</I> <I>int</I> type. The example uses the selector type because it is used by all system call prototypes in <I>RMXC. H.</I> The <I>#pragma interrupt</I> directive tells the compiler to generate the proper prologue and epilogue (e.g., <I>IRET</I>) for an interrupt function. The are also many built-in functions for dealing directly with the 80x86 processor. In this example, <I>inbyte</I> and <I>outbyte</I> functions are used for reading and writing I/O ports.<P>
