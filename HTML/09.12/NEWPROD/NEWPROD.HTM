<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="028A_015F">Quarterdeck upgrades QEMM-386<A name="028A_015F"></FONT></h4></P>
Quarterdeck Office Systems, Inc. has released QEMM<I>-</I>386 version 6.0.<P>
New features include the ability to process embedded batch files in a user's Autoexec.bat file, and the ability to temporarily increase the high RAM region in high memory during a program's load and initialization. Optimize now can automatically exclude portions of high memory accessed by device drivers and TSRs.<P>
Users can also create "response files" that QEMM<I>-</I>386's LOADHI programs can use to get information about where and how to load programs high.<P>
Optimize now lets users view, browse and play with the list of device drivers and TSRs that the program has relocated to high<I>-</I>memory. QEMM<I>-</I>386 version 6.0 results from a new feature called Stealth. Quarterdeck's new "Stealth" technology hides a PC's ROM code, and makes its memory addresses mappable as High RAM, which is then usable for other purposes.<P>
Stealth technology is dependent upon ROM design. ROM implementations by hardware manufacturers may cause one or more of Stealth's strategies not to work. Optimize will test a user's PC with all Stealth methods and recommend which method to use. Optimize will only present Stealth options to users if it cannot load all TSR.s or drivers in high memory. If a laptop system supports Suspend<I>-</I>Resume, QEMM<I>-</I>386 automatically detects it.<P>
Until December 31, 1991, users may upgrade, from any previous version, for $30.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="028A_0161">Object-Oriented Programming Made Easier for DOS Developers<A name="028A_0161"></FONT></h4></P>
Borland International, Inc. has released Turbo C++ &amp; Turbo Vision, a programming language product comprised of Borland's Turbo C++ compiler and Turbo Vision C++, application framework.<P>
Turbo C++ &amp; Turbo Vision includes two compilers in one: an ANSI C compiler and a C++ compiler conforming to AT&amp;T C++ 2.0 specification. Turbo Vision provides support for streamable objects, allowing objects to be made "persistent" by reading them from and writing them to files. The Programmer's Platform is an integrated development environment that enables programmers to compile, debug and run C and C++ applications. Provides automatic overlay control and allows programmers to develop larger programs that take advantage of overlays that operate in 640K of memory. Context<I>-</I>sensitive, hypertext help with copy<I>-</I>and<I>-</I>paste examples for every runtime library function to enhance programer productivity and ease of use.<P>
Turbo C++ with Turbo Vision has a 100 percent ANSI<I>-</I>C compatible runtime library with more than 450 functions, including the Borland Graphics Interface, hands<I>-</I>on tutorials and primers on C and C++ programming. It is compatible with Borland C++ so that code written using Turbo C++ can be ported to Borland C++.<P>
Turbo C++ &amp; Turbo Vision requires DOS version 2.0 or later and operates on PC compatibles, and 640KB memory (512KB for command<I>-</I> line compiler), a hard disk with 7MB minimum of free disk space is required.<P>
The suggested retail price for Turbo C++ &amp; Turbo Vision is $199.95, upgrades consisting of Turbo Vision software and documentation for $99.95. Turbo Vision source code is available for $69.95.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="028A_0166">Garbage Collector for C<A name="028A_0166"></FONT></h4></P>
Systems Essentials Limited announced the availability of GC, a garbage collector for use with the C and Objective<I>-</I>C languages on Unix systems. GC makes it possible to create data structures with shared access to allocated memory without concern for freeing the memory.<P>
For the first time, C programmers can concentrate on using data structures which are efficient rather than replicating data to avoid the risk of memory leaks inherent in shared data. GC can easily be incorporated into most existing applications to "plug the leaks" in those applications.<P>
GC's proprietary algorithm combines the compiler independence of conservative mark and sweep collectors with the freedom from accesses to memory which is no longer used provided by copying collectors.<P>
A source license to GC is available from Systems Essentials Limited for $10,000.<P>
