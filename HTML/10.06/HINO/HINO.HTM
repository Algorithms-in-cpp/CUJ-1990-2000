Coronado Enterprises has released C++ Tutor v2.2. This tutorial contains example programs designed to be as generic as possible. Most should be compilable with C++ compilers that follow the AT&amp;T definition, version 2.1 or newer. Many of these examples will not work with earlier definitions because the language significantly changed with the version 2.1 update. The C++ tutorial contains a program to illustrate how to use objects in a practical sense. It is an adventure game where you are dropped off at the airport by your friend and you must get to the correct flight on time. The entire source code is included for your study. In addition, for C programmers, C Tutor (CUG252 and CUG253) is available from us, however, we will drop the Turbo C version of C tutor (CUG257 and CUG258) because it is obsolete now.<P>

Myron Turner (CANADA) has contributed a cross-reference utility for multiple module C programs, C-ACROSS. The program produces six indexes of functions, prototypes, and globals that enable a user to see across modules for use in checking and comparison. Function names are listed in hierarchical form showing the relationship between caller and callee for functions. Globals are listed in schematic descriptors that record all modifiers and qualifiers and enable checking of declarators across modules. C-ACROSS optionally generates a header file that includes prototypes from function definitions. It is also possible to list user-defined types and some preprocessor <I>#defines</I>. The input file must conform with ANSI C standards, have prototype form, and must be syntactically correct. The distribution contains a complete set of C source code, DOS executable code, and full documentation. The program was developed and tested under Microsoft QuickC.<P>
