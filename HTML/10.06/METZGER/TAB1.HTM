<pre>Interprocedural Call Analysis  Which functions are invoked

Interprocedural Alias          Which names refer to the
Analysis                       same location?
Interprocedural Pointer        Which pointers point to
Tracking                       which locations?
Interprocedural Scalar         Which functions (and
Analysis                       subordinates) use and assign
                               which scalars?
Interprocedural Constant       Which globals and formal
Propagation                    arguments are constant on
                               entry to which functions?
Interprocedural Array          Which functions (and
Analysis                       subordinates) use and assign
                               which sections of arrays?
Inline Analysis                Which functions should be
