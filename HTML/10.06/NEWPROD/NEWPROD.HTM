<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0135_009D">Blink<B><I>inc</I></B> Releases Language Independent Dynamic Overlay Linker<A name="0135_009D"></FONT></h4></P>
Blink<I>inc</I> released BLINKER 2.0, a tool for linking and creating dynamic overlays for programs written in Microsoft C, Assembler, QuickBASIC, Fortran, Pascal and BASIC PDS 7.1; Watcom C; Zortech C++; Clipper Summer '87 and Clipper 5.01; and Borland C, C++ and Assembler.<P>
Blink<I>inc</I> states that BLINKER 2.0 is the only linker to dynamically overlay Microsoft BASIC PDS 7.1, as well as the only linker to provide an integrated memory swap function that will save a running program to EMS/XMS, then shell out and run a second program. The swap feature requires less than 8KB overhead.<P>
BLINKER 2.0 supports the CodeView debugger and provides limited support for Borland's Turbo debugger. BLINKER 2.0 can use EMS/XMS during link time and provides overlay caching to EMS/XMS for overlaid code. BLINKER 2.0 includes a new technical reference manual and a Norton Guide help file.<P>
Blink<I>inc</I> plans continued support for its Clipper specific BLINKER 1.5.<P>
BLINKER 2.0 is priced at $299. Registered BLINKER users should receive upgrade information from Blink<I>inc</I>. For information, <I>contact Blink</I>inc, P.<I>O Box 7154, Richmond, VA 23221, (804) 355-4444, FAX (804)355-1676</I>.<P>

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0135_00A0">New Versions of Symantec's Macintosh Development Environments<A name="0135_00A0"></FONT></h4></P>
Symantec has announced new versions of their THINK C v5.0 and THINK Pascal v4.0. The new versions support Apple's System 7 and include additional object-oriented programming (OOP) capabilities.<P>
THINK C v5.0 runs under System 7 in both 24- and 32-bit modes, with or without virtual memory. Symantec stated that "THINK C is now 100 percent ANSI conformant." The new version adds a graphical class browser and new classes for dialogs, multi-window documents and System 7 support.<P>
Markers have been added to the editor for positioning in large files. An integrated source-level debugger can maintain break-points and data displays between sessions. Disassemble and Preprocess commands allow programmers to view their code in different forms. Programmers can generate link maps during the compile cycle with another new feature. The jump-table limit has been increased to support larger projects.<P>
Similar extensions have been added to THINK Pascal v4.0. An Instant Project feature can build a project with a single command.<P>
THINK C v5.0 requires a Macintosh Plus or higher, with at least 2MB RAM and Macintosh System Software v6.0 or higher. The debugger requires 2MB RAM and Multifinder. A hard disk is recommended, and required to use the THINK Class Library. Registered users can upgrade to THINK C v5.0 for $89, while the suggested retail price is $299.

<h4><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A name="0135_00A1">A New Memory Management Library<B></B> <B></B>from Kandu, Inc.<A name="0135_00A1"></FONT></h4></P>
Super Malloc, a one to one replacement for <I>malloc</I>, <I>realloc</I> and <I>free</I>, provides more memory for C and C++ programs. After adding a startup and a cleanup call and relinking with the Super Malloc library, programmers gain access to as much as 320KB of memory for <I>malloc</I><B> </B>(and C++ <I>new</I>).<P>
Super Malloc uses high memory available on most 80x86 PCs, using both Upper Memory Blocks (UMBs) and the High Memory Area (HMA) for up to 160KB of memory (depending on system configureation). Super Malloc can use the 64Kb EMS page frame of an EMS memory manager as conventional memory, and can use up to 96KB of graphics memory (if it is available and not needed for high resolution graphics).<P>
If expanded or extended memory is available, Super Malloc uses it for the memory-management overhead for conventional memory. Super Malloc is implemented in assembly language. The full Super Malloc library requires 8KB, but an application may omit <I>malloc</I> from the compilers run-time library. Super Malloc has been tested with Microsoft C; Turbo C and C++; and Zortech C and C++.<P>
Super Malloc comes with source code. The suggested retail price is $149. For more information <I>contact Kandu, Inc., 16 Cannon Drive, Hamilton, New Jersey 08690, (609) 587-7973</I>.<P>
