The name of the first file in this disk's directory identifies the volume,
issue number and revision of the disk. The format of this filename is:

    !CDmvvii.rrr

where

    ! = the '!' character
    m =   C for C Users Journal, W for Windows/DOS Developer's Journal
    vv =  volume
    ii =  issue
    rrr = revision (001 for initial release, 002 for next update, etc.)

The file UPDATE.DOC contains information about any additions or
corrections to material on the disk since the original magazine
publication.

If you have obtained this code from a floppy diskette or from CompuServe, the 
headings under the column "FILENAME" represent the names of .ZIP files.  All 
files listed under the filename are archived in the .ZIP file.

If you have obtained this code from UUNET, the headings under the column 
"FILENAME" represent the names of subdirectories.  All files listed under the
"filename" are included in a subdirectory of that name.

Keywords: Mar96 C C+ Template Quicksort Quad Boolean SQRT <utility>

The code listings for the Mar 1996 issue of C/C++ Users Journal include
source code for Kenneth Van Camp's template-based Quicksort algorithm,
George F. Frazier's time-to-transfer estimation code, Don Bockenfeld's
Square Root Algorithm, Larry Brunelle's combination generator, and Tim
Prince's Quad-Precision math functions.  Also
included are source listings from P.J. Plauger's column, Standard C/C++,
Dan Saks' column, Stepping Up to C++, and a table from Bobby Schmidt's
column, the Learning C/C++urve.

    quadmath.c	 - complete, unchopped source code
    newatan2.c	 - updated, increased accuracy atan2l() function which
                   does not compute acosl() and asinl().  If you use
                   this in place of the function in quadmath.c, you must
                   also insert newacosl.c to get acosl() and asinl().
    newacosl.c	 - new, stand-alone, increased accuracy acosl() and asinl()
                   functions which can be used to replace those in
                   quadmath.c.
