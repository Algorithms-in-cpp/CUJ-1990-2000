------------------------------------

This archive contains listings from an issue of C/C++ Users Journal.
See the file FILENAME.TXT for a description of the archive contents.

If there are any restrictions on the distribution or use of any files in

Other than in cases of such explicit restrictions, R&D Publications,
Inc. places no restrictions on the distribution or use of this source
code.  We encourage you to add it to your user group library or BBS
archives; if you do so, we would greatly appreciate hearing from you,
so we can know to where the code has traveled.

What Is CUJ?
------------

C/C++ Users Journal is written by sophisticated programmers for
sophisticated programmers.  We insist on practical treatments of real
programming problems, or on tutorials that make theory or complex
issues more accessible to practicing programmers.  In place of
product reviews, we publish user reports that show -- with insight
backed by experience -- how to use commercial products that aid the
program developer.  Our emphasis is on C and C++, or on tools used in
conjunction with these languages. Back issues and quantity reprints
of selected articles are available.

---------------
Writing For CUJ
---------------

If you have an idea for an article and experience that would qualify
you to write for other programmers, please ask us for a set of author's
guidelines.

We pay at rates that are competitive with other national technical
journals.  We believe that our editorial assistance is better than most. 
You don't have to be a professional writer to meet our acceptance
criteria, but you must have something to say. 

A proposal consists of a brief abstract and outline, preferably totaling
no more than one page, and a brief resume of your qualifications.  When
mailing the proposal, please include a hard copy and an ASCII text file
on an MS-DOS formatted disk. 

You MUST submit your manuscript on an MS-DOS disk.  Files must be in raw
ASCII format, flush left, with one empty line between paragraphs.  Code
should be no wider than 64 columns.  Keep any code as brief as possible
and to the point.  If you ignore any of these requirements you increase
the probability that an otherwise acceptable article will be rejected. 

All topics pertinent to advanced programming issues in C and C++ are
appropriate for proposals.
