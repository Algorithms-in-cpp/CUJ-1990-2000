where

    ! = the '!' character
    m =   C for C Users Journal, W for Windows Developer's Journal
    vv =  volume
    ii =  issue
    rrr = revision (001 for initial release, 002 for next update, etc.)

The file UPDATE.DOC contains information about any additions or
corrections to material on the disk since the original magazine

Keywords: Jul96 C C+ HTML Extensibility Nested Pipe <memory> Abstract

The code listings for the July 1996 issue of C/C++ Users Journal include
source code for Don Colner's article on HTML programming with
objects, Bill Heyman's article on named pipe servers for Windows, and
James Bell's nested for-statement technique.  Also
included are source listings from P.J. Plauger's column, Standard C/C++,
Dan Saks' column, C++ Theory and Practice, and two listings contributed
by readers to our Letters to the Editor department.
