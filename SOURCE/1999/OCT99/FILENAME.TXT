surface component for Borland C++Builder, Jonathan Ringle's thread-safe
singleton creation technique, Robert Gray and Gisli Hjalmtysson's
dynamic C++ classes, Evgeniy Gabrilovich's method of controlling the
destruction order of singleton objects, Marc Briand's recursive visit
template, and Ivan Johnson's method of safer graphical drawing with MFC.
Also included are listings from P.J. Plauger's column, Standard C/C++,
Pete Becker's column, The Journeyman's Shop, and a listing contributed
with a Letter to the Editor.
