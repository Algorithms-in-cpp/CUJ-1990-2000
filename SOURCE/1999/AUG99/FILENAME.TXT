The code listings for the August 1999 issue of C/C++ Users Journal
include source code for Thomas Becker's semaphore with priorities for
Win32, Michael Bertrand's classes to manage TrueType fonts, John
Harrington's classes for multithreading without using MFC, Paul
Carlson's automatic process shutdown DLL, and Fred Persi's vector class
for Geometric computations. Also included are listings from P.J.
Plauger's column, Standard C/C++, and Dan Saks' column, C++ Theory and
Practice.
