Keywords: Feb99, C, C++, Y2K, LCD, embedded, multithreading, matrix

The code listings for the February 1999 issue of C/C++ Users Journal
include source code for Edward Lansinger's lightweight C++ library for
embedded LCDs, Leon Iofin's data compression formats for Y2K
remediation, Etienne Richards' technique of adding level-2 thread safety
to existing objects, and Mike Rumore's LUP matrix decomposition technique
using templates. Also included are listings from Dan Saks' column, C++
Theory and Practice.
