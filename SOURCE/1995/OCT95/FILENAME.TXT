The name of the first file in this disk's directory identifies the volume,
issue number and revision of the disk. The format of this filename is:

    !CDmvvii.rrr

where

    ! = the '!' character
    m =   C for C Users Journal, W for Windows/DOS Developer's Journal
    vv =  volume
    ii =  issue
    rrr = revision (001 for initial release, 002 for next update, etc.)

The file UPDATE.DOC contains information about any additions or
corrections to material on the disk since the original magazine
publication.

If you have obtained this code from a floppy diskette or from CompuServe, the 
headings under the column "FILENAME" represent the names of .ZIP files.  All 
files listed under the filename are archived in the .ZIP file.

If you have obtained this code from UUNET, the headings under the column 
"FILENAME" represent the names of subdirectories.  All files listed under the
"filename" are included in a subdirectory of that name.

Keywords: Oct95 C C+ Exception Debugging Pointer Bitmap Warping International

The code listings for the Oct 1995 issue of C/C++ Users Journal include
source code for Jon Jagger's debug function macro, Robert Mashlan's
Checked Pointers for C++, Alessandro Vesely's exception debugging
technique, Tim Kientzle's Bresenham bitmap scaling algorithm, and Dwayne
Phillips' image processing software for warping and morphing.  Also
included are listings from P.J. Plauger's column, Standard C/C++, and
Dan Saks' column, Stepping Up to C++.
