Keywords: Jun94 C C++ Interpolation Multi-Precision Integer float streambuf

The code listings for the June 1994 issue of The C Users Journal
include source for Philip Gages's Divided-Difference Interpolation
Program, John K. Gotwals' multi-precision integer arithmetic functions,
and Tim Prince's float-precision math library, and a header for the C++
streambuf class.
