issue number and revision of the disk. The format of this filename is:

    !CDmvvii.rrr

where

    ! = the '!' character
    m =   C for C Users Journal, W for Windows/DOS Developer's Journal
    vv =  volume
    ii =  issue
    rrr = revision (001 for initial release, 002 for next update, etc.)

The file UPDATE.DOC contains information about any additions or
corrections to material on the disk since the original magazine
publication.

If you have obtained this code from a floppy diskette or from CompuServe, the 
headings under the column "FILENAME" represent the names of .ZIP files.  All 
files listed under the filename are archived in the .ZIP file.

If you have obtained this code from UUNET, the headings under the column 
"FILENAME" represent the names of subdirectories.  All files listed under the
"filename" are included in a subdirectory of that name.

The code listings for the July 1994 issue of C/C++ Users Journal include
listings to illustrate Norman Wilde's software development technique,
source code for Dr. Rainer Storn's code checking tool,  Adam Greissman's
structure-mapping classes, Chuck Allison's C++ exception handling
illustrations, and a header for the C++ istream class.
